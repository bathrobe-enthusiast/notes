"The value of studying alternative systems of belief is that it helps us to see the limitations of our own initial assumptions. We may, for example, learn new ways of viewing the relationship between the individual and the community, how to balance the private and the public good, the duties of the present to future generations. We can learn both from what they said, and from the spirit in which they said it, the courage with which they confronted their crises. One example is the different ways in which ancient thinkers tried to explain, humanize, and come to terms with the phenomenon of the large state. We need to view the wisdom of the present with the same scepticism and openness as we view the wisdom of the past."
