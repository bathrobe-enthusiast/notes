In ancient Indian theory, caste came first, kingship second. So this was sacred monarchy with a difference. Kingship, though sacred, was not the sole or supreme agency of the divine in society. It is true that 'in the Vedic period the chief/king assumed identity with various gods during certain state rituals’; he could be regarded as a ‘deva’ with supernatural faculties. A good king could, as in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China, have a beneficial effect on nature and the cosmos. But he was not identified with the supreme god Brahma, nor was he Brahma’s ‘Son or representative’. The fundamental role of sustaining the social order by ritual sacrifice and teaching the Vedas belonged to the brahmins. In the *Mahabharata* the relationship was expressed by saying that ‘a brahmin is the root of the tree of Justice; the sovereign prince is its stem and branches; the ministers are its leaves and blossoms; just government is its fruit’ (in Spellman 1964: 124). It is important to note, however, that in the *Mahabharata* the good king is generally portrayed as acting quite independently of brahmins.

In the Egyptian and Mesopotamian traditions, the king could intervene in all aspects of social life—he was theoretically omnipotent. In India, kingship functioned alongside, and within, the system of castes. Varna received ‘most of the loyalty elsewhere felt towards king, nation and city’ (Finer 1997: 1211).
