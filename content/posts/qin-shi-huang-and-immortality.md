By ruthlessly gathering control over the empire into his own hands, Qin Shi Huangdi had hoped to establish a rule that, in the words of the contemporary historian Sima Qian, “would be enjoyed by his sons for ten thousand generations.” In fact, his centralizing zeal alienated many key groups. Landed aristocrats and Confucian intellectuals, as well as the common people, groaned under the censorship of thought and speech, harsh taxes, and forced labor projects. “He killed men,” recounted the historian, “as though he thought he could never finish, he punished men as though he were afraid he would never get around to them all, and the whole world revolted against him.” Shortly after the emperor died in 210 B.C.E., the dynasty quickly descended into factional rivalry, and four years later it was overthrown.
