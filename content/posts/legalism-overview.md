A ruler undertakes policies which, even though ‘people do not have the sense to rejoice in them’, are for their long-term benefit (Han Feizi, Basic Writings, 128–9); he ‘does not indulge the people’s desires, he simply looks ahead for what will benefit them’. The ruler may have to enforce his measures ‘against the will of the people’. The goals of the state—prosperity, stability, and expansion—were the only ones which would make life tolerable for the majority of people, and they were ones which people would choose if they could see sufficiently far ahead. This was their justification for compulsory labour, taxation, military service, and severe punishments.

This was the reasoning behind the policy, advocated by Shang Yang and
others, and first implemented in the state of Qin, of making punishments
exceptionally severe but predictable. With what would nowadays appear
breathtaking honesty, they advocated rule by fear as the most efficient way of securing the greatest good of the greatest number (Han Feizi, Basic Writings, 104). Only when light offences are ‘regarded as serious’ do ‘serious ones have no chance of coming’.

War and killing are permissible so long as the aim is to abolish them. This means achieving what people want by means they do not want (Book of Lord Shang, 230, 285). It is only by going against the wishes of the people that you make them happy. ‘What I call punishment is the basis of righteousness, but what the world calls righteousness is the way of violence’ (Han Feizi, in Wang and Chang 1986: 46). In other words, they were implying that the outcome desired by Confucius could only be achieved by means he refused to contem- plate. It simply could not be achieved by persuasion and example (Book of Lord Shang, 325). The true lesson of history was that a great king ‘seized the world by force, but held it by righteousness’—an almost prophetic statement when one looks at the first two dynasties of the Chinese empire.
