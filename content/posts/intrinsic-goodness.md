"People are born good" ([a pillar of Eastern religions](../eastern-vs-western-religions/)) basically goes against the "blank slate" idea first proposed by John Locke in the 17th century. Jonathan Haidt proposes in his theory of moral foundations that there are six innate foundations of moral reasoning:
1. Care/Harm
2. Fairness/Cheating
3. Loyalty/Betrayal
4. Authority/Subversion
5. Sanctity/Degradation
6. Liberty/Oppression

Authority/Subversion - mechanism by which hierarchy operates, and hierarchy/rule-following/conduct is necessary for [high population density (see: confucianism)](../confucianism-population-density/) societies or groups. Authority becomes a moral feature for some who "live in societies".

This is the crux of politics, anyway: how to live in a society with others.
