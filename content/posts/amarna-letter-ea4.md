Extract of letter between Babylonian and Egyptian king, ambiguous as to whether it was between Amenhotep III and Kadasman Enlil I.

> ...Moreover, you, my brother, when I wrote to you about marrying your daughter, in accordance with your practice of not giving a daughter, wrote to me, saying, 'From time immemorial no daughter of the King of Egypt is ever given to anyone' Why not. You are king; you do as you please.
