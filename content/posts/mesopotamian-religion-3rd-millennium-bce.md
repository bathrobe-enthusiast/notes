**3rd millennium BCE – the sword**  
As the settled areas of the country grew and joined, the protection that had been afforded by relative isolation was no longer there and fear of enemy attack, death or slavery, became a part of life ever present in the depth of consciousness.
- Rise of great city-walls that around the towns in this period - the staggering amount of labor that must have gone into them.
- For a shield against danger men looked to the now vitally important institutions of collective security, the great leagues and their officers, and particularly to the new institution of kingship as it took form and grew under the pressures of these years.

The evidence suggests that kingship originally was a temporary office: a king was chosen as leader when war threatened and ceased to exercise authority once the emergency was over. Now, the emergency had become chronic, and the office of king had become permanent because of it, so had his army and the manning and maintenance of the city wall. Gradually, leadership in all major communal undertakings devolved on the king and became united in his person.

### Grafting the ruler metaphor onto the gods
The ruler metaphor - expressed in the terms "master," "lord," and "warrior" - fits particularly well the unbounded power of the natural phenomenon in which the god is experienced, and the prayer cogently conveys awe before the wholly other, the terrifying power in the flood-wave sweeping down from the mountains.

### Implications for their worldview: cosmos as polity
The ruler metaphor – like the ruler concept - could not be lifted out of the social and political context from which it derived its meaning. The new view of the gods as rulers brought the whole political context of the ruler to bear on them and thus - since they were the powers in all the significant phenomena around - on the whole phenomenal world. The universe became a polity.

Hence:  
- Most major gods held office and had roles to play

In many cases these roles were essentially the old ways of the fertility powers, but they are now less expressions of the gods' innate natures than charges conferred on them by a high-ranking god such as An or Enlil, or by the assembly of the gods as a whole. Thus Ningirsu/Ninurta, the power in the spring thunderstorms is not merely expressing his inner essence, he is fulfilling his duties in a cosmic office: he is Enlil's "warrior" doing battle for him with the highlands. Similarly, Enki, god of the fresh waters in rivers and marshes, is no longer merely the power for fertility in those waters. He is an official charged by An with such duties as:

> To clear the pure mouths of the Tigris and  
Euphrates, to make verdure plentiful,  
make dense the clouds, grant water in abundance  
to all ploughlands,  
to make grain lift its head in furrows  
and to make pasture abundant in the desert,  
to make young saplings in plantations and in orchards  
sprout where planted like a forest.  

Enlil himself is no longer the power in the wind, "Lord Wind," but has charge of all winds and has them do his bidding.

### A growing paradox: the god's new function of upholding justice, derived from the role of "ruler", and that human justice may not be upheld.

See: [Lament for Ur](../poem-lament-for-ur/)

"[...] In reality, then, justice - that is to say, human justice - quails before the absolute authority of the unanimous will of the gods; they are not to be challenged."

### Conclusions
The gods, seen as kings and rulers, were no longer powers in nature only, they became powers in human affairs – in history.
