Dharma: ethics, duty, morality, virtue, social order
Artha: defined by Kautilya as "the subsistence of men" or the "land supplied with men" - political interest/necessity

### Conflict of morality and political survival
A working out of the conflict between dharma and artha, explored in the section of the *Mahabharata* known as the *Bhagavad Gita*.

On the eve of the final battle, the god Krishna gave Arjuna a transcendent justification of the doctrine of karma. Arjuna was in a quandary: ‘facing us in the field of battle are teachers, fathers and sons...These I do not wish to slay, even if I myself am slain’. To this Krishna replies: ‘if any man thinks he slays, and if another thinks he is slain, neither knows the ways of truth. The Eternal in man cannot kill: the Eternal in man cannot die...But to forgo this fight for righteousness is to forgo thy duty and honour: it is to fall into transgression’ (1: 34–5; 2:19, 33). By doing one’s caste duty here and now, therefore—in Arjuna’s case, as a warrior—whatever the consequences, one will acquire benefits through karma in one’s next life.

This was a unique resolution to the conflict between morality and practicality. It avoids the Machiavellian move of denying the validity of moral norms. It implies a statist sense of duty to the public order comparable to what we find in Roman tradition (where Brutus allows the execution of his own son).
