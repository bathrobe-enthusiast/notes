### First furnace: Bloomer
Iron ore and charcoal are fired enough - but not at temperatures high enough to cause iron to melt and flow away from the slag. Instead, hot but still solid lumps - 'blooms' - or iron made with slag are removed from the furnace and hammered to separate the metal as pure *wrought iron*.

Established in Anatolia ~1300 BCE.

### Second furnace: Blast Furnace
- Taller furnace, with bellows at the bottom to pump air up, thereby attaining higher temperatures for melting the iron.
- Adding limestone as 'flux' helps the iron to flow, improving its separation. This molten iron is then drained out of the base of the furnace as *pig iron*, or *cast iron*.
- High in carbon (~3%), which makes it strong but brittle.

Operated in 5th century BCE in China, 11th century CE by the Arabs, late 1300s in Europe.

### Third furnace: Electric Arc Furnace
