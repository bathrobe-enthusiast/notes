The invading/displaced Sea Peoples from the Aegean swept across the Eastern Mediterranean c. 1200 BCE. The Hittite Empire collapsed, Ugarit was permanently destroyed, and Egypt went into decline, despite the victory of Ramses III. Fortunately, the Phoenician cities survived (one theory is that they allied themselves with the Sea Peoples). Ill-fated, the Mycenaean civilization also fell and, thus, Greece entered its “Dark Age”. Western culture was devastated and now largely isolated from the cosmopolitan Near East. Creating a vast, mercantile network—as well as filling the Aegean vacuum—was Phoenicia.
