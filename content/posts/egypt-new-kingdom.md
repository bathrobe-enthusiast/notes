During the period of the New Kingdom, Egypt created an empire and became the most powerful state in the Middle East.  

New Kingdom: 1539 - 1069 BCE
- 18th to 20th dynasties
- The power of the New Kingdom pharaohs was aided by massive wealth, which they showed by building new temples. Queen Hatshepsut (ca. 1503–1480 B.C.E.), one of the first women to become pharaoh in her own right, built a great temple at Deir el Bahri near Thebes. Hatshepsut was succeeded by her nephew, Thutmosis III (ca. 1480–1450 B.C.E.), who led seventeen military campaigns into Syria and Canaan and even reached the Euphrates River. Egyptian forces occupied Canaan and Syria and also moved westward into Libya.
- Amenhotep IV (1364 - 1347 BCE) and his wife Nefertiti introduced the worship of Aten, god of the sun disk, as the supreme god and later in his reign as the only god. He changed his name to Akhenaten (servant of Aten). Akhenaten’s preoccupation with his religious revolution caused him to ignore foreign affairs and led to the loss of both Syria and Canaan. Akhenaten’s changes were soon undone after his death by the boy-pharaoh Tutankhamun, who restored the old gods. The eighteenth dynasty soon came to an end.
- The nineteenth dynasty managed to restore Egyptian power one more time. Under Ramesses II (ca. 1279–1213 B.C.E.), the Egyptians regained control of Canaan, but new invasions in the thirteenth century by the “Sea Peoples,” as the Egyptians called them, destroyed Egyptian power in Canaan and drove the Egyptians back within their old frontiers. The days of Egyptian empire were ended, and the New Kingdom itself expired with the end of the twentieth dynasty in 1069 B.C.E. For the next thousand years, despite periodic revivals of strength, Egypt was dominated by Libyans, Nubians, Persians, and finally Macedonians after the conquest of Alexander the Great. In the first century B.C.E., Egypt became a province in Rome’s mighty empire.
