Most abundant metal in the Earth's crust (8%), but difficult to separate from its ore. Only towards the end of the 19th century did its mass production become possible, by passing electricity through its molten ore.

Widely used:
- building material
- food packaging
- airplanes

Aluminium is very lightweight, so it came into its own with the expansion of aviation from WWI.
