The Israelite monarchy’s greatest contribution to Jewish political thought was its failure. Military collapse demolished any strong theory of monarchy in Israel.  

The experience of the Jewish community in exile in Babylon (6th century BCE) reinforced and transformed the sense of their uniqueness as a nation. They became a highly self-conscious community with a new conception of government and politics. The basis of the community was its religion and law. Kingship was now seen as an optional extra, a temporary and accidental feature of public life. In the sacred Jewish scriptures, kingship was presented as an alien graft, not part of the essential Israel, not an instrinsic part of its observance of the Law, nor of its worship of the one true god. They had learned to live, though not by choice—and, they hoped, not for long—as a stateless nation. To what extent they needed any form of governmental authority would be experienced and reflected upon over the ages, by Jews and then by others who associated themselves with this Jewish experience (notably, the early Christians and Shi’ite Muslims). Out of this came also anarchism and communism.
