Religions originating in monsoon Asia: Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, Shinto

### Good and Evil (in the world)
Eastern religions recognize that there is evil in the world, and even evil people, *but* none of them ever developed the sharp dualism between good and evil that is characteristic of Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

In the Indian and Chinese view, *all of creation is the work of God/Heaven*, which thus necessarily includes both good and bad, or what is seen by humans as good or bad.

Hence:
- No conception of "originl sin" inherent in individuals
- No Garden of Eden, no early innocence from which people fell

Evil was understood as *part* of God's created world, not as some human aberration.

### Human Nature
Basic presumption of Eastern religions:
- People are born and remain good.
- Misbehavior is a failure of *society* which God creates imperfect OR of the individual straying from teaching
- People are always redeemable through education or renewed efforts at right behavior
- Merit may be won by good deeds eg. charity - one does not have their sin "forgiven" by a priest or ritual.


### Attitude to the Natural World
Eastern religions accept the natural world as good, as part of a divine creation *greater and more powerful than humankind, but like humans, part of the cosmos*. Nature is seen as a nurturing mother or an inspiring model.

People occupy a humbler place in God's creation -> hence *people* should adjust, while seeking the image of God in *nature*, rather than themselves. **Adapting to nature and understanding it are keys to earthly success and spiritual and moral truth**.

vs.  

Western religions' explicitly opposite attitude:
- Book of Genesis calls the human world to "have dominion" over all the world of nature
- 19th and 20th century Western drive for the "conquest of nature"

One could argue that Judaism was conceived in a harsher environment than the great Eastern religions.
See: [Mesopotamian religion](../mesopotamia-state-and-religion/) - the environment in which Judaism was born.
