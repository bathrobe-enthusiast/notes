According to the Book of Judges, the Hebrews were herdsmen who had just begun to establish permanent settlements around the time of the Philistines' arrival in the Levant. They had organized themselves into twelve tribes - extended clan units whose families owed one another mutual aid and protection in times of war, but who frequently fought over cattle and grazing rights.

By the middle of 1200 BCE, these tribes occupied two major territories: Judah in the south, Israel in the North.

The Philistines conquered the Levantine coast around 1050 BCE.

Around 1025 BCE, an influential tribal judge called Samuel selected a king, Saul, to lead Hebrew resistance against the Philistines. (However, Saul proved to be an ineffective war leader, blocking further intrusion but not ousting the Philistines from the valleys/coastal plains, hence Samuel withdrew his support and threw it behind a young warrior in Saul's entourage, Saul's son-in-law, David.)
