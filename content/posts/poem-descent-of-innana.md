The story begins with a whim, a sudden desire of Inanna for the netherworld, a desire that comes to rule her to the exclusion of everything else:

> She set her heart from highest heaven  
on earth's deepest ground,  
the goddess set her heart from highest heaven  
on earth's deepest ground,  
Inanna set her heart from highest heaven  
on earth's deepest ground,  
milady abandoned heaven, abandoned earth,  
went down to Hades,  
Inanna abandoned heaven, abandoned earth,  
went down to Hades.  

And when she comes up to find a substitute for her death, she sees her husband enjoying himself. And so she gives the deputies of death their head:

> She looked at him, it was a look of death,  
spoke to them, it was a word of wrath  
cried out to them, it was the cry of "guilty!"  
"Take this one along!"  
Holy Inanna gave the shepherd Dumuzi into their hands.
