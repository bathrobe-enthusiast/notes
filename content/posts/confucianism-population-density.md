Li, in Confucianism, is a formalization of the philosophy behind the clearly sanctioned rules and behaviour that underpin Asian societies.

> High yields have always supported large populations in monsoon Asia.

> The states and empires of monsoon Asia were built consistently on their common peasant base of intensive, high-yield agriculture, which provided the great bulk of revenues, the manpower for armies, and the highly structured social order. [...] The village worlds were largely self-governing and self-regulating, thanks to the family system, the kin network, and the basic social institutions common to the area as a whole, but they formed the essential foundation for the building and maintenance of empires.
