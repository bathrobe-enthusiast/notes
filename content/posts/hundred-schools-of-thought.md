Main themes of Chinese political thought: state and monarchy

### State
Nature of scholar bureaucrats: 1. as political advisors, working in public service with a rank in the state hierarchy, they had a voice in the formation of the state; 2. as *itinerant* political advisors, which gave them leverage and contributed to their intellectual independence.

Hence:  
> In no other culture would the history of thought and the history of the state be so closely intertwined. Ethical and philosophical reflection developed in response to the increasingly problematic political situation. This was the period of ‘a hundred schools’. China produced a greater variety of political ideas than any other monarchical agrarian civilization.

### Monarchy
All Chinese theories emphasized the need for a single locus of authority, a quasi-absolute monarch, to resolve the problem of human discord.

### What Qin dynasty inaugurated
> For more than two millennia this imperial government seemed to have a staying-power and a power of self-renewal which one finds in religions—but less often in states—in other parts of the world. In ancient China [...] ‘political thought’ had a somewhat different function from the equivalent genre elsewhere. It brought together what we in the West divide into the sacred and the secular. Religions such as Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam were similarly based on sacred texts. But these supported a system of belief and practice rather than a system of government. China was the only text-based state.
