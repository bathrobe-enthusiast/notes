The title is something of a misnomer - they're not that rare. Lanthanum, for example, is almost as abundant as copper and nickel in the Earth's crust, and is 3 times more so than lead. And all the REMs are at least 200x more common than gold.

The problem isn't their overall abundance in the crust but the difficulty in extracting them. They tend to not become enriched into high-grade ores (eg. BIFs) but thinly dispersed in low concentrations through rocks, so on the whole, mining them specifically isn't economically feasible.
