### Yahweh
- So high above all else that no king could claim to represent him - "politically unobtrusive"
- Did not need extravagant gifts which many of these hill people could ill afford anyway - no priestly class was necessary

> An ideological innovation on this scale was perhaps necessary [...] to validate their new political identity, which separated them so radically from all other peoples. It enabled them to survive as the type of economic entity which they aspired to be. 

Re: Economic entity  
The Law stipulated that (rephrased) the "means of production (land, herds and flocks)" should be owned inalienably by extended families. The Jewish laws "inhibited social stratification" by eg. prohibiting interest on loans and the sale of land outside the family.

Further background:
> This Neo-Assyrian threat was the whetstone on which the Yahwist prophets sharpened their demands for an exclusive monotheism that went beyond monolatry. Hebrew prophets were practical political leaders as well as religious figures, and most of them understood that military resistance to the Neo-Assyrians was futile. So if the Hebrews were to survive as a people, they had to emphasize the one thing that separated them from everyone else in the known world: the worship of Yahweh and the denial of all other gods. The prophetsâ€™ insistence that Yahweh alone should be exalted was thus an aggressive reaction to the equally aggressive promotion of Assur by the Neo-Assyrians.
