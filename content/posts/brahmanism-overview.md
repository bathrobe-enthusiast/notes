According to the Rig Vedas, when Brahma, the supreme god, destroyed himself to create the four classes of the society, the *brahmins* - the priest class - were made from his head, the *kshatriyas* - the warrior, [king](../ancient-india-kingship), administrator class - were made from his arms, the *vaishyas* - the merchants - were made from his thighs, and the *sudras* - the labourers and servants - came from the feet.

Brahmins, kshatriya, vaishyas, are *twice-born* - undergoing a ceremony at puberty whereby they're initiated into adulthood and Indian society.
