Confucius: 551 - 479 BCE.

### *Li* and *Ren*
*Li*: ritual, custom, decorum, propriety, ethics - a concept extended from a code of conduct and traditional conventions of social intercourse to embrace a "broad range of political activities, such as personnel policy, [and] proper handling of rewards and punishments", so that it came to comprise the "entire way of governing". Interpretation of the ethical and societal norms of *li* was the focus of Confucian thought.

*Ren*: 'to overcome the self and turn to *li*. The inner rationale that motivates people to observe *li*. The humaneness that legitimizes political order (as interpreted by Mengzi, Confucius's disciple). Confucius insisted that humaneness was the fundamental norm not only ofhuman conduct, but of political conduct and civilized government. It laid down both the goal and the methods of politics; it stipulated a harmonious society in which the virtuous lead by example. 

For Confucius, government works best when the ruler is humane; the praxis was government by consensus - Heaven looking out from the little people, which enlightened paternalism is needed to lead, teach, and treat well. Persuasion is better than coercion. Confucius saw violence as the break- down of politics.

Confucianism saw the state as a family.
