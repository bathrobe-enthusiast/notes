Old Kingdom: 2575 - 2125 BCE
- 4th to 8th dynasties
- By the fourth dynasty, a bureaucracy with regular procedures had developed. In time, Egypt was divided into provinces or nomes, as they were later called by the Greeksâ€”twenty-two in Upper Egypt and twenty in Lower Egypt. A governor, called a nomarch by the Greeks, was head of each nome and was responsible to the king.
- 2540 BC: Pyramid of Giza built under King Khufu
