**4th millennium BCE – famine**  
Early Mesopotamian economy was precarious and uncertain, based on [artificial irrigation](../mesopotamian-irrigation/), and the powers to whom they turned were the powers in and behind their primary economics on which life depended: herding, agriculture(, and fishing). 

The aim and purpose of their cults were to insure the presence of these essential powers for fertility, produce, and food. Houses – temples – were built for them so that they might dwell with men as members of the human community.
- i.e. ziggurats
- this seems to be true of egyptian temples as well

Examples:
- [meditations on death](../poem-deadly-diseases/)
- [wedding texts - an example of how the economic setting shaped the rite](../poem-wedding-texts/)
- [depiction of winter starvation in a poem](../poem-descent-of-innana/)
