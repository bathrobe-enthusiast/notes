Laozi: Confucius's contemporary. Daoism is authored in 道德经.

Laozi proposed a return to primitive simplicity, withdrawal from the world, spontaneity. They thought that society had become overdeveloped, overheated.

> 'The more prohibitions and rules, the poorer the people become... The more elaborate the laws, the more they commit crimes'.

Corruption and oppression were the inevitable results of civilization and were brought about precisely by those whom others idealized—rulers and sages. In this view, the state is part of the problem, part of humanity’s misguided attempt to control the world. Solutions to human problems are to be sought only in the individual mind. This was the counter-culture.

### Monarchy
Some Daoists thought that the sage-ruler is himself 'the unmoving director of the world': his beneficence consists in going with the flow of events, like water flowing downhill; Laozi spoke of a sage-ruler perfectly in tune with Heaven and Earth, and with 'the hearts and minds of the people'. 'When he acts, he takes no credit', for 'the people say "we did it ourselves".
