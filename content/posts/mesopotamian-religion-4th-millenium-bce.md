**4th millenium BCE – famine**  
The powers to whom they turned were powers in and behind their primary economics on which life depended: fishing, herding, agriculture, as even the briefest look at the character of the chief gods of their cities will show. Aim and purpose of their cults were to insure the presence of these essential powers for fertility produce, and food. Houses – temples – were built for them so that they might dwell with men as members of the human community.
- i.e. ziggurats
- this seems to be true of egyptian temples as well
