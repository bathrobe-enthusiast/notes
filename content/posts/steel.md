Steel: an alloy of iron with a small amount of carbon, typically 1% or less.


### Importance
Properties vary with carbon %: low-carbon steel is soft but tough, high-carbon steel is hard but brittle. In the early years, wrought iron was cooked with charcoal to absorb carbon, or wrought and cast iron were mixed to adjust proportions; high0quality steel remained laborious to create and was reserved for critical applications eg. cutting edge of knives/swords, springs in clocks.

### Development

## "Our current age of cheap, mass-produced steel began in the 1850s with the development of a simple way to remove carbon from pig iron."

In the US, post-Civil War, railroads were the largest single employer of labour. Railroad expansion meant a greater need for coal, iron, and later steel, to build railroad cars and lay track. 

(The steel industry was a catalyst for a host of other industries; in 1859, the value of US manufactured goods was $1.9 billion, but by 1899 it had risen to $13 billion with the rise of industrial giants like Carnegie Steel.
