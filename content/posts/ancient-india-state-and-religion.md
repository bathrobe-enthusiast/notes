Social hierarchy: classical texts specified *varna*, a system of four classes in society; this was instantiated into the caste system, *jati*, where people are born into a clan (*jati*) that specifies social and economic duty, and requirements for endogamy.

It's thought that this class system was introduced by the Aryans, [when they first arrived in India](../ancient-india-history/).

Philosophies that emerged from this background:
- [Brahmanism](../brahmanism-overview/), which later developed into Hinduism
- [Buddhism](../buddhism-overview/)

Both of which were underwritten by the concept of *karma* - the sum/worth of one's actions in life that decide one's fate in their next life, and in brahmanism, this is accumulated through carrying out *dharma* - ethics, duty.
