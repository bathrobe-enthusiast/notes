**Background**  
In many poleis, the circle of the aristocratic elite tightened further as smaller and smaller groups came to dominate higher offices. One option for aristocrats left outside of their own culture, looking in was to form an alliance with the rising class of hoplites, who had complaints of their own about exclusion from poitical power. And occasionally, a single aristocrat with the backing othe hoplites would succeed in setting up an alternative form of government, a *tyranny*.

**Tyranny: its meaning**  
The word *tyrannos* had been borrowed from the Lydians: it signified someone who ruled outside the traditional framework of the polis. A tyrant was not necessarily an abusive ruler.

**and implications**  
Tyranny often led the way to wider political enfranchisement: a would-be tyrant who had sought the support of the hoplite class would have to appease that class by extending further rights of poitical participation, while all the time striving to keep the reins of power in his own hand.

Tyrannies rarely lasted for more than two generations and could drive transition from aristocracy to a more broadly participatory form of government: democracy.
