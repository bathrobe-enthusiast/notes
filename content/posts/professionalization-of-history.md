The professionalization of history was initiated in nineteenth-century German universities. Leopold von Ranke and his colleagues considered nation building to be the proper subject of history, and they privileged state archives as the appropriate sources for such a project. Eager to claim scientific objectivity, professors carefully policed the boundaries of their masculine, nation-centered discipline and derided any deviations or attempts to write history as literature. Lucy Maynard Salmon, author of the path-breaking social history *Domestic Service* (1897), incurred the ridicule of colleagues in analyzing historical recipes and kitchen appliances alongside more traditional documents.
