            <p><strong>2nd millenium BCE – guilt</strong><br>
Personification of a man’s luck and ability to effectively think and act is identified with some known figure of the pantheon, usually a minor deity.</p>
<p>Sumerian composition: “Man and his God”</p>
<ul>
<li>Man complains that what he knows does not come out right, what he says quite truthfully turns out to be false, he does things in all innocence and finds that he has been duped into committing wrong.</li>
<li>His god – his powers of clear and fast thinking – is not there to suggest an answer when friends deceive him, or when evil-doers abuse him; his god has abandoned him and lost interest in him</li>
<li>Realization: blame lies with himself</li>
<li>Plead: no man is perfect</li>
<li>He asks to be shown his faults, his transgressions, that he may confess them before his god and be forgiven; God is moved by his contrition and takes him back into favour</li>
</ul>
<p>The insight gained in the preceding millennium that the divine stands for, and upholds, a moral law -&gt; is now bearing fruit in a realization of individual human responsibility, but also of innate human inability to live up to that responsibility</p>
