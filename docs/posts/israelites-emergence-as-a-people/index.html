            <p>According to the Book of Judges, the Hebrews were herdsmen who had just begun to establish permanent settlements around the time of the Philistines&rsquo; arrival in the Levant. They had organized themselves into twelve tribes - extended clan units whose families owed one another mutual aid and protection in times of war, but who frequently fought over cattle and grazing rights.</p>
<p>By the middle of 1200 BCE, these tribes occupied two major territories: Judah in the south, Israel in the North.</p>
<p>The Philistines conquered the Levantine coast around 1050 BCE.</p>
<p>Around 1025 BCE, an influential tribal judge called Samuel selected a king, Saul, to lead Hebrew resistance against the Philistines. (However, Saul proved to be an ineffective war leader, blocking further intrusion but not ousting the Philistines from the valleys/coastal plains, hence Samuel withdrew his support and threw it behind a young warrior in Saul&rsquo;s entourage, Saul&rsquo;s son-in-law, David.)</p>
