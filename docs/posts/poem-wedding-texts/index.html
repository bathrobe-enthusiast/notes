<p>&ldquo;The sequence of the nuptial drama is thus clear, but a great deal of the meaning of the text remains dark and unexplained. To understand this we must understand what the powers stand for.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>The bride, Inanna, represents the numen of the communal storehouse for dates.</li>
<li>The bridegroom, Dumuzi, represents what is to be stored in the storehouse - the power behind the yearly burgeoning of the palm and its producing its yield of dates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, for example, is the odd &ldquo;gem-revealing heap&rdquo;?<br>
Why do Inanna&rsquo;s wedding ornaments come from it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That a heap of fresh dates should furnish the ornaments for Inanna is logical since freshly harvested dates are the pride and adornment of the bare shelves of a storehouse for dates. The date clusters that are to adorn the shelves of the storehouse become ritually experienced as traditional feminine adornments and jewelry such as would be suitable for decking out a human bride, and the heap from thich they are taken comes close to becoming ajewel shrine of sorts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is Dumuzi to be taken back to it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That these two powers are wed means that the power for fertility and yield has been captured by the numen of the storehouse - and so by the community - and has become its trusty provider for all time.</p>
<p>Dumuzi is safely in the storehouse, and the community revels in abundant food and drink, release from anxiety and fear of starvation, blissfully secure from want. Inanna expresses the communal feeling precisely: not love or the raptures of passion mark her wedding night, but a gently glowing sense of inner and outer bliss in trust and security:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Not only is it sweet to sleep hand in hand with him,</em><br>
<em>Sweetest of sweet is too the loveliness</em><br>
<em>of joining heart to heart with him.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-later-developments-of-the-cultivators-wedding-text">2. Later developments of the cultivators&rsquo; wedding text</h3>
<p>The scope of blessings expected increases. Now it ranges from  the yields of farmers and shepherds to the take of fishermen and fowlers, from the wildlife in woods and marshes to the produce of vineyards and gardens.</p>
<p>This contrasts with the first cultic wedding text, the Uruk Text. There the god, Dumuzi-Amaushumgalanna, was the power in the fertility and yield of the date palm only, and the underlying ritual was a date harvest ritual and nothing else. This concentration on a single major economy is, we should judge, an original feature, but as the cities drew a variety of economies into their orbit - Uruk, for instance, seems to have united several settlements of date growers, oxherders, and shepherds - the purview of the cult broadened so as to make its god stand for a general fertility and yield.</p>
<p>Such a broadening is already suggested on the Uruk Vase of the outgoing fourth millennium where the bridal gifts brought by the god include not only dates but ears of grain and sheep heavy with wool.</p>
<p><strong>Different portrayals of this economic diversification</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dumuzi is a shepherd; the farmer, the fishermen, and the fowler are wedding attendants, bringing gifts of their product to supplement what the shepherd provides.</li>
<li>Dumuzi is both a shepherd and farmer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-the-herders-wedding-text">3. The herders&rsquo; wedding text</h3>
<p>In the song Inanna, glorying in her young body, which has just attained puberty, sings the praises of her pubic triangle with its as yet sparse growth of hairs, comparing it first to a metal enchasement with decorative studs sticking out like linchpins in a cartwheel, then to a ceremonial barge called the &ldquo;Barge of Heaven&rdquo; (the recent hairs she sees as mooring ropes holding the barge), and the image leads over into that of the cosmic barge of heaven, the crescent of the new moon. Next her triangle has become a virginal plot in the desert, not yet cultivated, then again a stubble field on which ducks have been put out to be fattened, black hairs dotting it like black ducks against light dun soil, then it is a high-lying field, hillock land, piled up with levees, well watered in readiness for ploughing - she has just bathed in water - and then moist lowlands similarly readied. Since a woman, though she may own fields, cannot herself plough them but must seek a ploughman to do it for her, the song ends with the question of who he should be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;My enchased parts so nailed down</em><br>
<em>as (with) linchpins</em><br>
<em>attached to a big cart,</em><br>
<em>(my crescent-shaped) &ldquo;Barge of Heaven,&quot;</em><br>
<em>so (well) belayed,</em><br>
<em>full of loveliness, like the new moon,</em><br>
<em>my untilled plot,</em><br>
<em>left so fallow in the desert,</em><br>
<em>my duck field so studded with ducks,</em><br>
<em>my hillock land, so (well) watered,</em><br>
<em>my parts, piled up with levees,</em><br>
<em>(well) watered</em><br>
<em>I, being (but) a maiden,</em><br>
<em>who will be their ploughman?</em><br>
<em>My parts, (well) watered lowlands,</em><br>
<em>I, being (but) a lady,</em><br>
<em>who will put (plough) oxen to them?&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the elegist responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Young lady, may the king plough them for you!</em><br>
<em>May the king, Dumuzi, plough them for you!&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is obviously the right answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The man of my heart! The ploughman is the man of my heart!&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Herder Wedding Text&rdquo; ends on much the same note as the other wedding texts, with delight in great abundances of food. Yet, there is one subtle difference. The riches here garnered by Inanna - milk and milk products - are short-term only. They will not, like the more durable riches of the date harvest, last through an approaching dry season and free the community from want until the next season. The sense of having reached security which informs the wedding texts of Amaushumgalanna can have little relevance in the herder&rsquo;s world with its swiftly passing blessings.</p>
<p>That world has, rather, its own set of relevant experiences. In spring the desert fills with green, the herds gambol in the pastures and mate, and from that mating flows the herder&rsquo;s prosperity; increase of flocks and herds, newborn lambs, kids, and calves, plentiful milk from the full udders of the mother animals. In the herder&rsquo;s view the emphasis of the sacred marriage is therefore on its mating aspect. He sees it as a divine engendering which brings into being spring&rsquo;s glorious burst, the sacred cosmic sexual act in which all nature is fertilized.</p>
<p>This emphasis comes through clearly in Inanna&rsquo;s frank praise of her private parts with its central image of the field ready for the fertilizing seed plough - an image, incidentally, which still does not take us outside the herder&rsquo;s world since the plough oxen were provided by the cowherders.</p>
<p>Thus the orchardman&rsquo;s and the herder&rsquo;s rite of the sacred marriage differ fundamentally. The first is a harvest rite binding the date palm&rsquo;s power for fertility and yield to the numen of the storehouse in bonds of marriage and mutual love. The other is a fertility rite uniting - by incarnating them in human actors - the divine powers for fertility and new life in a generative sexual embrace.</p>
