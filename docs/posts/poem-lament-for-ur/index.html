            <p>Some extracts from the Lament for Ur, in which the goddess of Ur, Ningal, tells how she pleaded with the divine assembly, but to no avail, and the consequent destruction of Ur.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then verily, to the assembly,<br>
where the crowd had not yet risen,<br>
while the Anunnaki, binding themselves<br>
(to uphold the decision), were still seated,<br>
I dragged my feet and I stretched out my arms,<br>
truly I shed my tears in front of An.<br>
Truly I myself mourned in front of Enlil:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;May my city not be destroyed!&rdquo;<br>
I said indeed to them.<br>
&ldquo;May Ur not be destroyed!&rdquo; I said indeed to them.<br>
&ldquo;And may its people not be killed!&rdquo;<br>
I said indeed to them.<br>
But An never bent towards those words,<br>
and Enlil never with an, &ldquo;It is pleasing, so be it!&rdquo;<br>
did soothe my heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(Behold,) they gave instruction<br>
that the city be destroyed,<br>
(behold,) they gave instruction<br>
that Ur be destroyed,<br>
and as its destiny decreed<br>
that its inhabitants be killed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The city is doomed, and the execution of the terrible decree is left to Enlil. Stating in plain terms what we know happened we could say that wild mountaineers from the East - Elam and the Sua people - invaded Sumer, besieged Ur, and, when eventually the inhabitants surrendered the city, sacked and burned it mercilessly. But plain terms would be entirely inadequate to convey what the Sumerians knew took place. In a cosmic sense it was Enlil&rsquo;s own destructive essence expressed in his element the storm that destroyed Ur. The wild hordes from the mountains were but incidental form in which that essence clothed itself, the reality was Enlil&rsquo;s storm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enlil called the storm.<br>
The people mourn.<br>
Winds of abundance he took from the land.<br>
The people mourn.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Good winds he took away from Sumer.<br>
The people mourn.<br>
Deputed evil winds.<br>
The people mourn.<br>
Entrusted them to Kingaluda, tender of storms.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He called the storm that annihilates the land.<br>
The people mourn.<br>
He called disastrous winds.<br>
The people mourn.<br>
Enlil - choosing Gibil as his helper -<br>
called the (great) hurricane of heaven.<br>
The people mourn.<br>
The (blinding) hurricane howling across the skies -<br>
the people mourn -<br>
the storm that annihilates the land roaring over the earth -<br>
the people mourn -<br>
the tempest unsubduable like breaks through levees,<br>
beats down upon, devours the city&rsquo;s ships,<br>
(all these) he gathered at the base of heaven.<br>
The people mourn.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(Great) fires he lit that heralded the storm.<br>
The people mourn.<br>
And lit on either flank of furious winds<br>
the searing heat of desert.<br>
Like flaming heat of noon this fire scorched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is this storm that destroys the city:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The storm ordered by Enlil in hate,<br>
the storm which wears away the country,<br>
covered Ur like a cloth,<br>
veiled it like a linen sheet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it clears away all is over:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On that day did the storm leave the city;<br>
that city was a ruin.<br>
O father Nanna, that town was left a ruin.<br>
The people mourn.<br>
On that day did the storm leave the country.<br>
The people mourn.<br>
Its people(&lsquo;s corpses), not potsherds,<br>
littered the approaches.<br>
The walls were gaping;<br>
the high gates, the roads,<br>
were piled with dead.<br>
In the wide streets,<br>
where feasting crowds (once) gathered<br>
jumbled they lay.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In all the streets and roadways bodies lay.<br>
In open fields that used to fill with dancers,<br>
the people lay in heaps.<br>
The country&rsquo;s blood now filled its holes,<br>
like metal in a mold;<br>
bodies dissolved - like butter left in the sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] In reality, then, justice - that is to say, human justice - quails before the absolute authority of the unanimous will of the gods; they are not to be challenged.</p>
