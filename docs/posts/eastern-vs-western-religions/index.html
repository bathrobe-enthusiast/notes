<h3 id="good-and-evil-in-the-world">Good and Evil (in the world)</h3>
<p>Eastern religions recognize that there is evil in the world, and even evil people, <em>but</em> none of them ever developed the sharp dualism between good and evil that is characteristic of Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam.</p>
<p>In the Indian and Chinese view, <em>all of creation is the work of God/Heaven</em>, which thus necessarily includes both good and bad, or what is seen by humans as good or bad.</p>
<p>Hence:</p>
<ul>
<li>No conception of &ldquo;originl sin&rdquo; inherent in individuals</li>
<li>No Garden of Eden, no early innocence from which people fell</li>
</ul>
<p>Evil was understood as <em>part</em> of God&rsquo;s created world, not as some human aberration.</p>
<h3 id="human-nature">Human Nature</h3>
<p>Basic presumption of Eastern religions:</p>
<ul>
<li>People are born and remain good.</li>
<li>Misbehavior is a failure of <em>society</em> which God creates imperfect OR of the individual straying from teaching</li>
<li>People are always redeemable through education or renewed efforts at right behavior</li>
<li>Merit may be won by good deeds eg. charity - one does not have their sin &ldquo;forgiven&rdquo; by a priest or ritual.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attitude-to-the-natural-world">Attitude to the Natural World</h3>
<p>Eastern religions accept the natural world as good, as part of a divine creation <em>greater and more powerful than humankind, but like humans, part of the cosmos</em>. Nature is seen as a nurturing mother or an inspiring model.</p>
<p>People occupy a humbler place in God&rsquo;s creation -&gt; hence <em>people</em> should adjust, while seeking the image of God in <em>nature</em>, rather than themselves. <strong>Adapting to nature and understanding it are keys to earthly success and spiritual and moral truth</strong>.</p>
<p>vs.</p>
<p>Western religions&rsquo; explicitly opposite attitude:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book of Genesis calls the human world to &ldquo;have dominion&rdquo; over all the world of nature</li>
<li>19th and 20th century Western drive for the &ldquo;conquest of nature&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>One could argue that Judaism was conceived in a harsher environment than the great Eastern religions.
