            <p>Two people key to its spread:</p>
<ul>
<li>Siddhartha Gautama</li>
<li>Ashoka</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="siddhartha-gautama">Siddhartha Gautama</h3>
<p>Born mid-sixth century BCE in the foothills of the Himalaya Mountains, in what is today southern Nepal, the son of a ruling kshatriya family.</p>
<p>Had a family, left his family, meditated under a tree, achieved enlightenment, spent the rest of his life preaching it.</p>
<p>His ideas can be viewed as a reformist form of Brahmanism, designed to transfer responsibility from the priests to the individual, much as the sixteenth century German monk Martin Luther saw his ideas as a reformation of Christianity. Siddhartha accepted the concept of reincarnation and the role of karma as a means of influencing the movement of individual souls up and down the scale of life. Nirvana, the extinction of selfhood and reunion with the Great World Soul, is likened to a dreamless sleep, rather than the Christian concept of heavenly salvation.</p>
<p>Four noble truths:</p>
<ol>
<li>Life is suffering.</li>
<li>Suffering is caused by desire.</li>
<li>The way to end suffering is to end desire.</li>
<li>The way to end desire is to avoid the extremes of a life of vulgar materialism and to follow the Middle Path.</li>
</ol>
<p>Middle Path: right knowledge, purpose, speech, conduct, occupation, effort, awareness, meditation.</p>
<p>All human beings can aspire to Nirvana as a result of their behaviour in this life.</p>
<p>Siddharta Gautama died in 480 BCE.</p>
<h3 id="ashoka">Ashoka</h3>
<p>Converted to Buddhism in the third century BCE, and sent Buddhist missionaries throughout India, and ordered the erection of stone pillars with official edicts and Buddhist inscriptions to instruct people in the proper way.</p>
<p>Ashoka died in 232 BCE, after which the Mauryan empire began to fragment into separate states - in 183 BCE, India reverted to disunity.</p>
