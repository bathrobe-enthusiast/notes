<p>Properties vary with carbon %: low-carbon steel is soft but tough, high-carbon steel is hard but brittle. In the early years, wrought iron was cooked with charcoal to absorb carbon, or wrought and cast iron were mixed to adjust proportions; high-quality steel remained laborious to create and was reserved for critical applications eg. cutting edge of knives/swords, springs in clocks.</p>

<h2 id="our-current-age-of-cheap-mass-produced-steel-began-in-the-1850s-with-the-development-of-a-simple-way-to-remove-carbon-from-pig-iron">&ldquo;Our current age of cheap, mass-produced steel began in the 1850s with the development of a simple way to remove carbon from pig iron.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In the US, post-Civil War, railroads were the largest single employer of labour. Railroad expansion meant a greater need for coal, iron, and later steel, to build railroad cars and lay track.</p>
<p>(The steel industry was a catalyst for a host of other industries; in 1859, the value of US manufactured goods was $1.9 billion, but by 1899 it had risen to $13 billion with the rise of industrial giants like Carnegie Steel.</p>
