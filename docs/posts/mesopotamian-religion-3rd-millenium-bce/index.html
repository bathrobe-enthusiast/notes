            <p><strong>3rd millenium BCE – the sword</strong><br>
As the settled areas of the country grew and joined, the protection that had been afforded by relative isolation was no longer there and fear of enemy attack, death or slavery, became a part of life ever present in the depth of consciousness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rise of great city-walls that around the towns in this period - the staggering amount of labor that must have gone into them.</li>
<li>For a shield against danger men looked to the now vitally important institutions of collective security, the great leagues and their officers, and particularly to the new institution of kingship as it took form and grew under the pressures of these years.</li>
</ul>
<p>The gods, seen as kings and rulers, were no longer powers in nature only, they became powers in human affairs – in history.</p>
