<p>Personification of a man’s luck and ability to effectively think and act is identified with some known figure of the pantheon, usually a minor deity.</p>
<p>Sumerian composition: “Man and his God”</p>
<ul>
<li>Man complains that what he knows does not come out right, what he says quite truthfully turns out to be false, he does things in all innocence and finds that he has been duped into committing wrong.</li>
<li>His god – his powers of clear and fast thinking – is not there to suggest an answer when friends deceive him, or when evil-doers abuse him; his god has abandoned him and lost interest in him</li>
<li>Realization: blame lies with himself</li>
<li>Plead: no man is perfect</li>
<li>He asks to be shown his faults, his transgressions, that he may confess them before his god and be forgiven; God is moved by his contrition and takes him back into favour</li>
</ul>
<p>The insight gained in the preceding millennium that the divine stands for, and upholds, a moral law -&gt; is now bearing fruit in a realization of individual human responsibility, but also of innate human inability to live up to that responsibility.</p>
<p>Thus: &ldquo;<em>many are my iniquities, slip them off (me) like a garment.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="uses-and-expands-the-metaphor-of-the-god-as-parent">&hellip;uses and expands the metaphor of the god as parent</h3>
<p>The inner &ldquo;form&rdquo; or &ldquo;metaphor&rdquo; of the parent, of &ldquo;father&rdquo; or &ldquo;mother&rdquo; under which the personal god came to be seen, serves as psychologically possible bridge to the great and terrifying awesome cosmic powers. For it is within human experience that even the highest, greatest, and most terrifying personages in society have a mild, human, and approachable side in their relations to their children. Children, in their immediacy, their certainty of being loved, can overcome - being entirely unaware of it - the terror and awe of power and status precisely because they seek and see only the personal in the relation. Thus the possibility that even the cosmic powers could be personal gods, could have an unfrightening, loving, ever-forgiving side toward their little human children, is psychologically conceivable.</p>
<p>But if we can thus, by following personal religion back to its original setting, see more clearly how its attitude could be psychologically possible, this does not change or remove the original and basic paradox with all its inherent contradictions. As the attitude began to permeate religion generally, as it could be assumed not only toward one&rsquo;s personal god, but toward any god, even the one and only God, it was inevitable that its paradoxical nature should become apparent. There is a stage in childhood when parents are all-powerful and divine to the child. The child (to grow up) has eventually to adjust to the disturbing realization that parents are after all only other human beings with human limitations. But in this case such adjustment was excluded. The divine parents were, and had to remain, divine. Thus experience could not but drive its cruel wedge ever more deeply between the dispassionate, terrifying, cosmic aspect of the divine which governed the way things really are and really happen, and the personal, concerned, angry, forgiving, loving aspect in which I, the individual, matter so profoundly that love for me must sway the uni- verse off its course to help and sustain me.</p>
<p>This is the problem of the righteous sufferer. It forces itself upon religious consciousness in Mesopotamia about the middle of the second millennium and is dealt with in two remarkable works, Ludlul bel nemeqi (&ldquo;Let me praise the expert&rdquo;) and the Babylonian Theodicy. In the first of these we hear about a man, pious and righteous, who nevertheless falls on evil days:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alu-disease has clothed itself in my body<br>
like a garment;<br>
sleep in a net enmeshes me;<br>
my eyes stare but see not,<br>
my ears are open, but hear not;<br>
weakness has seized all my body.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The unfeeling, cosmic aspect of the divine is taking its course with no regard for him at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No god came to my aid, or grasped my hand,<br>
my goddess did not pity me,<br>
walked not at my side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the incomprehensibility of the ways of the universe, of its failure to take account of him, is so great that he can only escape in doubt about himself and his own powers of judgment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What seems good to oneself,<br>
is a crime before the god.<br>
What to one&rsquo;s heart seems bad,<br>
is good before one&rsquo;s god.<br>
Who may comprehend the minds of gods<br>
in heaven&rsquo;s depth?<br>
The thoughts of (those) divine deep waters,<br>
who could fathom them?<br>
How could mankind, beclouded,<br>
comprehend the ways of gods?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contradictions are indeed insoluble as long as the attitude of personal religion is allowed to reduce existence, the infinite universe, to the narrow compass of a personal world, and expect it to center in an individual and his personal needs.</p>
<p>A significant step toward a solution was only made later, in the middle of the first millennium, by the religious genius of Israel: the treatment of the problem in the Book of Job. Here, in God&rsquo;s speech, the imbalance is redressed. The personal, egocentric view of the sufferer - however righteous - is rejected. The self-importance which demands that the universe adjust to his needs; his righteousness, is cast aside, and the full stature of God as the majestic creator and ruler of the universe is reinstated. The distance between the cosmic and the personal, between God in his infinite greatness and mere individual man, is so great and so decisive that an individual has no rights, not even to justice.</p>
