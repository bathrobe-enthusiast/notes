<p>It seems highly unlikely that the Chinese would not have adopted or adapted cuneiform instead of the far more cumbersome ideographic characters if they had been in touch with Mesopotamia or had imported ideas or techniques from there.</p>
<h3 id="bronzework">Bronzework</h3>
<p>Shang China stands alone in the technical perfection and beauty of its bronze work, sharply distinct from that of any other ancient culture and showing in China a long history of experimental progress, using varying proportions of copper, tin, lead, and zinc until the optimum mix was achieved. The farther one goes from the Shang centers, the cruder the bronze artifacts become; there is no trail leading from Sumer or Harappa.</p>
<p>Hence it seems that Chinese civilization, like Indian, was an independent innovation that was already well formed before it came into effective contact with other or older centers of equal sophistication.</p>
