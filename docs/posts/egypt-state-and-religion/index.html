<p>In Egypt the king was more closely identified with the gods than in any other culture. He was the incarnation of Horus and Osiris, the son of the supreme god Ra himself. He was the supreme representative of the religious as well as the political order. The king’s relationship to his subjects was thus also a spiritual relationship; the great god Ptah was in all living beings, so that the king was connected to the life-force (ka) of every individual. The king was revered as ‘greatest god’, the ‘perfect god’; he was said to have been conceived when Amun desired a royal wife, ‘the god’s wife’. The pharaoh ruled even over the netherworld as Osiris and ‘deceased father’. He was credited with the power of divine ‘utterance’, his word ‘became a reality immediately’.</p>

<p>It was the Egyptians who introduced the metaphor of the king as shepherd into political thought. What they meant was that, just as a landowner entrusts his sheep to a shepherd, the god transmitted his authority and responsibility to the king.</p>
<h3 id="kings-may-use-religion-but-they-cannot-invent-it">&ldquo;Kings may use religion, but they cannot invent it&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The idea of religious monarchy in Egypt was brought to a strange climax in an attempted religious revolution by Amenhotep IV (1350–1334 BCE). He proclaimed the Aten (sun-disc) as sole god, and proclaimed himself the son of the Aten. He abolished the festivals and processions of all other gods, including the supreme Amun, systematically destroying their images, monuments, and inscriptions. The capital was transferred to a new city, Amarna.</p>
<p>This was also the first documented attempt to impose belief on a population by force. It did not outlast Amenhotep himself; the traditional religion was promptly restored. The memory of Amarna was so hated, and all traces of it so effectively obliterated, that the whole episode has only recently come to light. The priests eventually exercised their own kind of theocracy, with the high-priest acting on behalf of Amun. The god was now regarded as the real king. This was related to a growing belief that the god communicated important political decisions through oracles. By the time of Alexander’s conquest of Egypt in 331 BCE, ‘the Egyptian kingship faded into mere theory’.</p>
