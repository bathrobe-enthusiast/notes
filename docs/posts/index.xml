      <title>Tyranny in Ancient Greece</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In many poleis, the circle of the aristocratic elite tightened further as smaller and smaller groups came to dominate higher offices. One option for aristocrats left outside of their own culture, looking in was to form an alliance with the rising class of hoplites, who had complaints of their own about exclusion from poitical power. And occasionally, a single aristocrat with the backing othe hoplites would succeed in setting up an alternative form of government, a &lt;em&gt;tyranny&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tyranny: its meaning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The word &lt;em&gt;tyrannos&lt;/em&gt; had been borrowed from the Lydians: it signified someone who ruled outside the traditional framework of the polis. A tyrant was not necessarily an abusive ruler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tyranny often led the way to wider political enfranchisement: a would-be tyrant who had sought the support of the hoplite class would have to appease that class by extending further rights of poitical participation, while all the time striving to keep the reins of power in his own hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyrannies rarely lasted for more than two generations and could drive transition from aristocracy to a more broadly participatory form of government: democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Sea Peoples Sweep Across the Eastern Mediterranean</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The invading/displaced Sea Peoples from the Aegean swept across the Eastern Mediterranean c. 1200 BCE. The Hittite Empire collapsed, Ugarit was permanently destroyed, and Egypt went into decline, despite the victory of Ramses III. Fortunately, the Phoenician cities survived (one theory is that they allied themselves with the Sea Peoples). Ill-fated, the Mycenaean civilization also fell and, thus, Greece entered its “Dark Age”. Western culture was devastated and now largely isolated from the cosmopolitan Near East. Creating a vast, mercantile network—as well as filling the Aegean vacuum—was Phoenicia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Athenian Democracy</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/athenian-democracy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to depending on the labor and fertility of women, Athenians were as reliant on slaves as Spartans were on helots. Without slavery, none of the Athenian accomplishments in politics, thought, or art would have been possible. The Athenian ideal of dividing and rotating governmental duties among all free men depended on slaves who worked in fields, businesses, and homes while free men engaged in politics. In fact, the Athenian democratic system began to function fully only with the expansion of Athenian mining and commerce around 500 B.C.E., which enabled the Athenians to buy slaves in larger numbers. Freedom and slavery were thus an inescapable contradiction of this democracy—much as they would be many centuries later in the United States, prior to the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more ways than one, Athenian freedom rested on the servitude of others. Slaves performed much of the labor at home, while Athens’ allies in the Delian League provided the resources that supported Athenian greatness. Without the surplus wealth flowing into Athens from the league, none of the projects Pericles undertook—pay for political participation, massive building projects, the patronage of Athenian drama—would have been possible. These projects kept Athens rich, its democracy vibrant, and Pericles in power. But ultimately, Athens’ foreign policy and imperial ambitions undermined these achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Athenian Political Background</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/athenian-political-background/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2020 00:22:03 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;consolidation-of-power-through-the-archaic-period&#34;&gt;Consolidation of power through the Archaic Period&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristocratic monopolization of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;elected offices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the city council, &lt;em&gt;Areopagus&lt;/em&gt;, which was composed of former office holders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;archonship&#34;&gt;Archonship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the seventh century BCE, executive authority in Athens lay entirely with the nine &lt;em&gt;archons&lt;/em&gt; presiding over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a high court with influence over hearing of cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appointed by the Areopagus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one year term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lifetime membership in the Areopagus after&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outcome of inequality: a significant proportion of the population fell into slavery through debt, while struggles among aristocratic families destabilized the government and fomented cycles of revenge killings. This situation eventually inspired the Athenians&amp;rsquo; first attempt to promulgate a set of written laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;establishing-democracy&#34;&gt;Establishing democracy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drakon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peisistratos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spartan-sponsored oligarchy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleisthenes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drakon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Also known as Draco, Drako. The first recorded legislator of Athens, replacing the prevailing system of oral law and blood feud with the first written constitution of Athens in 621 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His laws were harsh, hence &amp;ldquo;draconian&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A poet elected in 594 BCE as the sole archon for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solon’s legendary political and economic reforms laid the foundations for the later development of Athenian democracy. He forbade the practice of debt slavery and set up a fund to buy back Athenian slaves who had been sold abroad. He encouraged the cultivation of olives and grapes, thus spurring cash-crop farming and urban industries such as oil and wine production, and the manufacture of pottery storage jars and decorative drinking cups. He also broadened rights of political participation and set up courts in which a range of citizens served as jurors and to which any Athenian might appeal. He based eligibility for political office on property qualifications, thus making it possible for someone not born into the aristocracy to gain access to power. Moreover, he convened an Athenian assembly, the &lt;em&gt;ekklesia&lt;/em&gt; and gave it the right to elect archons. Now all free-born Athenian men over the age of eighteen could participate in government. Even those who were not eligible for citizenship were able to see the workings of government for themselves, since the assembled citizens met on the slopes of the Pnyx, a hill visible from the central marketplace and overlooked by the sacred precincts of the Acropolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solon’s reforms were not immediately accepted. The aristocracy thought them too radical; the people of the demos, not radical enough. In the resulting generation of turmoil&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peisistratos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
546 BCE: An aristocrat named Peisistratos establishes himself as tyrant (see: &lt;a href=&#34;../tyranny-in-ancient-greece/&#34;&gt;Tyranny in Ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat ironically, Peisistratos proceeds to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institute Solon&amp;rsquo;s reforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;launch a massive campaign of public works projects, including the collection and condification of Homer&amp;rsquo;s epics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;crush dissent mercilessly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ultimately, strengthen the political role of the demos and so remain a popular ruler until his death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His sons were less able to control the various factions that threatened their rule; one was assassinated and the other was ousted with the help of the Spartans in 510 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spartan-sponsored-oligarchy&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spartan-sponsored oligarchy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleisthenes&lt;/strong&gt;
Two generations of increasing access to power had left the Athenian demos with a taste for self-government, and a group of commoners rallied behind Cleisthenes, an aristocrat who championed the cause of the demos. Once voted in as archon in 508/7 BCE, Cleisthenes took steps to limit aristocratic power by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reorganizing the Athenian population into ten voting districts, hence suppressing traditional loyalties tied to certain aristocratic families&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strengthening Athenian assembly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extending democracy to the local level throughout Attica&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;introducing ostracism - whereby Athenians could decide each year whether they wanted to banish someone for a decade and, if so, whom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleisthenes hoped that with this, the demos could 1. prevent the return of a tyrant 2. quell factional strife if civil war seemed imminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;by-500-bce&#34;&gt;By 500 BCE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political struggles of the sixth century had given Athens a far more populist character than any other Greek polis and had strengthened its institutions of government. In the meantime, Athens had become the principal exporter of olive oil, wine, and pottery in the Greek world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;persian-wars&#34;&gt;Persian Wars&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: in the decades before the Persian Wars, political reforms in Athens had continued to encourage further experiments in democracy, including the practice of selecting major officeholders by lot. Only one key position was now filled by traditional voting: the office of &lt;em&gt;strategos&lt;/em&gt;, or general. And because a man could be elected stratgos year after year, this office became the career goal of Athens&amp;rsquo;s most ambitious figures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Themistocles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When the Athenians discovered a rich vein of silver ore in the Attic countryside, Themistocles persuaded them not to divide the windfall among themselves (the customary practice) but to finance a fleet of 200 triremes - state-of-the-art warships - thereby transforming Athens into the preeminent naval power of the Greek World&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cimon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;hellip;just in time to confront a new Persian onslaught, as Cimon led the Delian league to victories in 470s and 460s BCE. But Cimon also used the league to punish poleis who tried to opt out of membership, suppressing revolts by force of arms and turning the league into an instrument of Athenian policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 462-461 BCE, Cimon was ostracised by his rival&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pericles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;hellip;an aristocrat from one of Athens&amp;rsquo;s richest families, who rose to strategos on the enfranchisement of the thetes, the lowest class of free men and the rowers of the triremes, as his political platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He oversaw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a foreign policy oriented away from cooperation with Sparta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reforms that gave every citizen the right to propose and amend legislation, not just to vote yes or no in the citizen assembly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an average day&amp;rsquo;s wage for attendance in the assembly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and through the latter measures, thetes and other free men of modest means becoming a dominant force in politics, and loyal to the man who made that dominance possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the ambitions of Pericles, this populist program glorified Athens through an ambitious scheme of public building and lavish festivals honoring the gods, especially Athena. Personally, too, Pericles was a generous patron of the arts and sciences, attracting the greatest minds and talents of the day to Athens. His popularity, combined with his charisma and his promotion of the Athenians’ sense of superiority, ensured his reelection as strategos for the next three decades. During these years Athens flourished, but it also alienated much of the Greek world by its arrogance and aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Rare Earth Metals</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/rare-earth-metals/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The title is something of a misnomer - they&amp;rsquo;re not that rare. Lanthanum, for example, is almost as abundant as copper and nickel in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s crust, and is 3 times more so than lead. And all the REMs are at least 200x more common than gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t their overall abundance in the crust but the difficulty in extracting them. They tend to not become enriched into high-grade ores (eg. BIFs) but thinly dispersed in low concentrations through rocks, so on the whole, mining them specifically isn&amp;rsquo;t economically feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most abundant metal in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s crust (8%), but difficult to separate from its ore. Only towards the end of the 19th century did its mass production become possible, by passing electricity through its molten ore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widely used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building material&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;food packaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;airplanes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminium is very lightweight, so it came into its own with the expansion of aviation from WWI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steel: an alloy of iron with a small amount of carbon, typically 1% or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;importance&#34;&gt;Importance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Properties vary with carbon %: low-carbon steel is soft but tough, high-carbon steel is hard but brittle. In the early years, wrought iron was cooked with charcoal to absorb carbon, or wrought and cast iron were mixed to adjust proportions; high-quality steel remained laborious to create and was reserved for critical applications eg. cutting edge of knives/swords, springs in clocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-current-age-of-cheap-mass-produced-steel-began-in-the-1850s-with-the-development-of-a-simple-way-to-remove-carbon-from-pig-iron&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our current age of cheap, mass-produced steel began in the 1850s with the development of a simple way to remove carbon from pig iron.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, post-Civil War, railroads were the largest single employer of labour. Railroad expansion meant a greater need for coal, iron, and later steel, to build railroad cars and lay track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The steel industry was a catalyst for a host of other industries; in 1859, the value of US manufactured goods was $1.9 billion, but by 1899 it had risen to $13 billion with the rise of industrial giants like Carnegie Steel.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-furnace-bloomer&#34;&gt;First furnace: Bloomer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore and charcoal are fired enough - but not at temperatures high enough to cause iron to melt and flow away from the slag. Instead, hot but still solid lumps - &amp;lsquo;blooms&amp;rsquo; - or iron made with slag are removed from the furnace and hammered to separate the metal as pure &lt;em&gt;wrought iron&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established in Anatolia ~1300 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-furnace-blast-furnace&#34;&gt;Second furnace: Blast Furnace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taller furnace, with bellows at the bottom to pump air up, thereby attaining higher temperatures for melting the iron.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding limestone as &amp;lsquo;flux&amp;rsquo; helps the iron to flow, improving its separation. This molten iron is then drained out of the base of the furnace as &lt;em&gt;pig iron&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;cast iron&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High in carbon (~3%), which makes it strong but brittle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operated in 5th century BCE in China, 11th century CE by the Arabs, late 1300s in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Copper</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/copper/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 10:17:45 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The element takes its Latin name - &lt;em&gt;cuprum&lt;/em&gt; - from the island Cyprus, which provided most of the copper for Bronze Age craftsmen in the Mediterranean, Egypt and Mesopotamia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deposition&#34;&gt;Deposition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along mid-ocean spreading ridges - when hot magma is close to the surface, seawater enters the cracks, becomes superheated, and surges back up through the crust, leaching minerals out of the surrounding rock as it goes up into hydrothermal vents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence the name &amp;ldquo;black smokers&amp;rdquo;, referring to the precipitation of zinc, lead, gold, silver, manganese, suphides&amp;hellip; COPPER, cobalt, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cyprus&#34;&gt;Cyprus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility of copper on Cyprus due to a slice of ocenic crust that became beached on top of the continental, created in a spreading rift in the Tethys Sea ~90 mya and scooped up on top of Cyprus with the closure of the Tethys as Africa pushed up into Eurasia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the second millennium BC Cyprus became the major supplier of copper to Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Mediterranean world. As we have seen, in the Bronze Age charcoal was used to bake the metal out of its ore in copper smelting furnaces, and so Cyprus’s productivity also depended on a large supply of timber. In fact, by studying the 4 million tonnes of slag heaps on the island that were dumped as waste once the copper metal had been extracted from the mined rock, archaeologists have been able to calculate how much timber was required. It turns out that throughout the 3,000 years of copper production on Cyprus, the entire area of pine forests covering the plains and the mountainsides of the island would need to have been cleared at least sixteen times over – an early example of sustainable woodland management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(but the same subduction boundary that created the copper deposits on Cyprus runs past Crete, creating Thera (modern day Santorini), hence the eruption between 1600-1500 BCE.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-copper-deposits&#34;&gt;Other copper deposits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rio Tinto in Spain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noranda in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ural Mountains in Russia&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Limestone</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/limestone/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 07:44:25 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Limestone: calcium carbonate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;oolitic-limestone&#34;&gt;Oolitic limestone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly formed during the Jurassic Period, as warm, shallow seas flooded the land. Calcium carbonate from the shells of sea creatures eg. foraminifera precipitated as a limy mud, and as particles rolled back and forth around the seabed with tidal currents, becoming coated with concentric layers of this calcite mineral, they form balls called ooliths, which are then cemented together with more calcite to form oolitic limestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deposits found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;across Britain in a great sash from East Yorkshire, through Cotswolds, down to the Dorset coast. Oxford, in the middle of this band, has many of its colleges built out of this stone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isle of Portland, a promontory jutting out into the English channel, where it was laid down 150 million years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Southern Indiana, where it was laid down earlier than Portland stone, in the early Carboniferous period 340 million years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nummulitic-limestone&#34;&gt;Nummulitic limestone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made out of shells of giant foraminifera called &lt;em&gt;nummulites&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deposits found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Across a huge area from Northern Europe to Middle East to North Africa and SE Asia eg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nile, where they were used to build pyramids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This expansive region of nummulitic limestone was laid down in the warm, shallow margins of the Tethys Ocean, 40–50 million years ago. During this period of the early Eocene, global temperatures were elevated, and the high sea levels caused the Tethys Ocean to flood in great arms stretching to Northern Europe and across North Africa. Huge numbers of forams lived in the warm waters, and when they died great drifts of their coin-shaped shells made of calcium carbonate sank down and carpeted the seafloor. Over time, they became cemented together to form the nummulitic limestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;travertine&#34;&gt;Travertine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precipitates out of solution when water from hot springs cools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deposits found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tibur (modern day Tivoli, NE of Rome), where it was used for the main pillars and external walls of the Colosseum in Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;marble&#34;&gt;Marble&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metamorphosized limestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples:
Northern Mediterranean coastline - where this Tethyean limestone has been baked underground in the convergent plate boundaries around the Mediterranean – by magma rising up and intruding into it, or by its being caught in the tectonic vice crunching up mountain ranges like the Alps – it is metamorphosed into marble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence also its use as the signature stone of Classical Greek and Roman sculpture, monuments, and grand public buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deposits found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The city of Carrara, in northern Tuscany. This marble was used to built the Pantheon and Trajan&amp;rsquo;s Column, and was a favourite of Renaissance sculptors - eg. Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;David&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chalk&#34;&gt;Chalk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signature of the Cretaceous Period (100-66 mya) - &lt;em&gt;creta&lt;/em&gt; in Latin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deposits found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Southern England: most clearly visible on the South Coast, where it forms the eye-catching White Cliffs of Dover. It continues under the English Channel to France, where it has produced mirror-image white cliffs and provided the terroir of the great French wine regions of Champagne, Chablis and Sancerre.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This theology of Yahweh&amp;rsquo;s transcendence would later contribute to subsequent Western religions - the teaching that God is not part of nature but exists outside of it. God can therefore be understood, in purely intellectual or abstract terms, as entirely separate from the operations of the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the Book of Judges, the Hebrews were herdsmen who had just begun to establish permanent settlements around the time of the Philistines&amp;rsquo; arrival in the Levant. They had organized themselves into twelve tribes - extended clan units whose families owed one another mutual aid and protection in times of war, but who frequently fought over cattle and grazing rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the middle of 1200 BCE, these tribes occupied two major territories: Judah in the south, Israel in the North.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philistines conquered the Levantine coast around 1050 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 1025 BCE, an influential tribal judge called Samuel selected a king, Saul, to lead Hebrew resistance against the Philistines. (However, Saul proved to be an ineffective war leader, blocking further intrusion but not ousting the Philistines from the valleys/coastal plains, hence Samuel withdrew his support and threw it behind a young warrior in Saul&amp;rsquo;s entourage, Saul&amp;rsquo;s son-in-law, David.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Region: West Asia and Mediterranean&lt;br&gt;
Time: 14th century BCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This Late Bronze Age was an age of superpowers. The great pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty had transformed Egypt into a conquering state, and the Hittites had created an empire out of the disparate city-states and kingdoms of Anatolia. The Assyrians controlled Near Eastern trade, and the Kassite kingdom of Babylonia remained a significant force in economic and military relationships. In addition to these imperial entities, numerous smaller states also flourished and extended their influence westward into the Mediterranean. Holding it all together was a network of trade routes that created an interdependent Afro-Eurasian world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egyptians delighted in Canaanite glass, Greeks prized Egyptian amulets, and the merchants of Syria admired Greek pottery and wool.
This was the background for the development of the abjad (the consonant-only family of alphabet later giving rise to the Phoenician alphabet). Ugarit, on the coast of modern-day Syria, developed the Ugaritic alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shang China in isolation from other cultures</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;writing&#34;&gt;Writing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems highly unlikely that the Chinese would not have adopted or adapted cuneiform instead of the far more cumbersome ideographic characters if they had been in touch with Mesopotamia or had imported ideas or techniques from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bronzework&#34;&gt;Bronzework&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shang China stands alone in the technical perfection and beauty of its bronze work, sharply distinct from that of any other ancient culture and showing in China a long history of experimental progress, using varying proportions of copper, tin, lead, and zinc until the optimum mix was achieved. The farther one goes from the Shang centers, the cruder the bronze artifacts become; there is no trail leading from Sumer or Harappa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence it seems that Chinese civilization, like Indian, was an independent innovation that was already well formed before it came into effective contact with other or older centers of equal sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People are born good&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;../eastern-vs-western-religions/&#34;&gt;a pillar of Eastern religions&lt;/a&gt;) basically goes against the &amp;ldquo;blank slate&amp;rdquo; idea first proposed by John Locke in the 17th century. Jonathan Haidt proposes in his theory of moral foundations that there are six innate foundations of moral reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Care/Harm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fairness/Cheating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loyalty/Betrayal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authority/Subversion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sanctity/Degradation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liberty/Oppression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authority/Subversion - mechanism by which hierarchy operates, and hierarchy/rule-following/conduct is necessary for &lt;a href=&#34;../confucianism-population-density/&#34;&gt;high population density (see: confucianism)&lt;/a&gt; societies or groups. Authority becomes a moral feature for some who &amp;ldquo;live in societies&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the crux of politics, anyway: how to live in a society with others.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eastern vs Western Religions</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/eastern-vs-western-religions/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 04:39:36 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/eastern-vs-western-religions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Religions originating in monsoon Asia: Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, Shinto&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;good-and-evil-in-the-world&#34;&gt;Good and Evil (in the world)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastern religions recognize that there is evil in the world, and even evil people, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; none of them ever developed the sharp dualism between good and evil that is characteristic of Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Indian and Chinese view, &lt;em&gt;all of creation is the work of God/Heaven&lt;/em&gt;, which thus necessarily includes both good and bad, or what is seen by humans as good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No conception of &amp;ldquo;originl sin&amp;rdquo; inherent in individuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Garden of Eden, no early innocence from which people fell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evil was understood as &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of God&amp;rsquo;s created world, not as some human aberration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;human-nature&#34;&gt;Human Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic presumption of Eastern religions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are born and remain good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misbehavior is a failure of &lt;em&gt;society&lt;/em&gt; which God creates imperfect OR of the individual straying from teaching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are always redeemable through education or renewed efforts at right behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merit may be won by good deeds eg. charity - one does not have their sin &amp;ldquo;forgiven&amp;rdquo; by a priest or ritual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;attitude-to-the-natural-world&#34;&gt;Attitude to the Natural World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastern religions accept the natural world as good, as part of a divine creation &lt;em&gt;greater and more powerful than humankind, but like humans, part of the cosmos&lt;/em&gt;. Nature is seen as a nurturing mother or an inspiring model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People occupy a humbler place in God&amp;rsquo;s creation -&amp;gt; hence &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; should adjust, while seeking the image of God in &lt;em&gt;nature&lt;/em&gt;, rather than themselves. &lt;strong&gt;Adapting to nature and understanding it are keys to earthly success and spiritual and moral truth&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western religions&amp;rsquo; explicitly opposite attitude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book of Genesis calls the human world to &amp;ldquo;have dominion&amp;rdquo; over all the world of nature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19th and 20th century Western drive for the &amp;ldquo;conquest of nature&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue that Judaism was conceived in a harsher environment than the great Eastern religions.
See: &lt;a href=&#34;../mesopotamia-state-and-religion/&#34;&gt;Mesopotamian religion&lt;/a&gt; - the environment in which Judaism was born.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Li, in Confucianism, is a formalization of the philosophy behind the clearly sanctioned rules and behaviour that underpin Asian societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High yields have always supported large populations in monsoon Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states and empires of monsoon Asia were built consistently on their common peasant base of intensive, high-yield agriculture, which provided the great bulk of revenues, the manpower for armies, and the highly structured social order. [&amp;hellip;] The village worlds were largely self-governing and self-regulating, thanks to the family system, the kin network, and the basic social institutions common to the area as a whole, but they formed the essential foundation for the building and maintenance of empires.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>REST</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/rest/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 17:43:33 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/rest/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Representational State Transfer (REST) style is an abstraction of the architectural elements within a distributed hypermedia system. REST: a set of design constraints - first identified in Roy Fielding&amp;rsquo;s 2000 dissertation on software architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;client-server&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;statelessness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;caching&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;layering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uniform interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hypermedia as the engine of application state&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;client-server&#34;&gt;Client-server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separation of UI concerns from data storage concerns improves portability of UI across multiple platforms and improves scalability by simplifying server components. Most importantly, this separation allows components to evolve independently and thus support Internet-scale requirements of multiple organization domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;statelessness&#34;&gt;Statelessness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visibility: single request carries its own context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliability: recovering from partial failures is easier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability: not having to store state between requests frees up resources; not having to manage resource usage across requests simplifies implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradeoff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase in repetitive data -&amp;gt; decrease in network performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;caching&#34;&gt;Caching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resources can declare themselves cacheable or not; performance improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;layering&#34;&gt;Layering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way. Shared caching within a layered system may offset reduction in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;uniform-interface&#34;&gt;Uniform Interface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style from other network-based styles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniform Interface &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Metadata encapsulating shared understanding of data types between client and server&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distributed hypermedia architect has only three fundamental options: 1) render the data where it is located and send a fixed-format image to the recipient; 2) encapsulate the data with a rendering engine and send both to the recipient; or, 3) send the raw data to the recipient along with metadata that describes the data type, so that the recipient can choose their own rendering engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information about true nature of data remains hidden in server -&amp;gt; client implementation easier BUT limited, and scalability problems as most of the processing load is on the sender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides information hiding while enabling specialized processing of the data via its unique rendering engine, but limits the functionality of the recipient to what is anticipated within that engine and may vastly increase the amount of data transferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows the sender to remain simple and scalable while minimizing the bytes transferred, but loses the advantages of information hiding and requires that both sender and recipient understand the same data types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REST provides a hybrid of all three options by focusing on a shared understanding of data types with metadata, but limiting the scope of what is revealed to a standardized interface. REST components communicate by transferring a representation of a resource in a format matching one of an evolving set of standard data types, selected dynamically based on the capabilities or desires of the recipient and the nature of the resource. Whether the representation is in the same format as the raw source, or is derived from the source, remains hidden behind the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, efficient for large-grain hypermedia data transfer, which is the common use case of the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 technologies make this possible: URI, HTTP, HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;uri-universal-resource-identifier&#34;&gt;URI: Universal Resource Identifier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key &lt;em&gt;abstraction&lt;/em&gt; of information in REST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; that might be the target of a hypertext reference must fit within the definition of a resource i.e. a resource is&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A conceptual mapping to a set of entities, NOT the entity that corresponds to the mapping at any point in time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resource &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; is a temporally varying membership function &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;r(&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;), which for time &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; maps to a set of entities, or values, which are equivalent. The values in the set are called &lt;em&gt;resource representations&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;resource identifiers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resource can map to the empty set, which allows (hypertext) references to be made to a concept before any realization of that concept exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This abstract definition of a resource enables key features of the Web architecture. First, it provides generality by encompassing many sources of information without artificially distinguishing them by type or implementation. Second, it allows late binding of the reference to a representation, enabling content negotiation to take place based on characteristics of the request. Finally, it allows an author to reference the concept rather than some singular representation of that concept, thus removing the need to change all existing links whenever the representation changes (assuming the author used the right identifier).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;http-hypertext-transfer-protocol&#34;&gt;HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;works on HTTP message entities, a specific instance of a &lt;em&gt;representation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representation: captures the current/intended state of that resource, and comprises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metadata describing the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;METADATA describing the METADATA - usually for verifying message integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP: a standard describing the actions a client can take on a resource.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The client has no direct control over resource state on the server, but is able to manipulate it by sending HTTP requests to URLs identifying a resouce - this HTTP request can include a representation eg. in a POST request, and the server can sends back a representation as well of the resource (State).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;html-hypertext-markup-language&#34;&gt;HTML: Hypertext Markup Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;writes &lt;em&gt;hypermedia&lt;/em&gt;, which informs clients about the kind of HTTP requests they&amp;rsquo;re allowed to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypermedia: media defined by the presence of application control information embedded within, or as a layer above, the presentation of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypermedia controls have three jobs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tell the client how to construct an HTTP request: what HTTP method to use, what URL to use, what HTTP headers and/or entity-body to send.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They make promises about the HTTP response, suggesting the status code, the HTTP headers, and/or the data the server is likely to send in response to a request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They suggest how the client should integrate the response into its workflow;  describe the relationships between resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypermedia is the engine of application state&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
i.e. we all navigate the Web by filling out links. Application state: which web page the client is on; hypermedia: the method a server uses to explain to a client what it can do next. State transitions on both client and server are effected by hypermedia links.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Han Confucianism</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/han-confucianism-overview/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Background: unification and centralization by Qin provided a milieu in which the gentlemanly culture of Confucianism could flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han Confucianism was thus a conflation of earlier Confucianism, mystical cosmology, and authoritarian statism (CHC i. 107, 652). The Zhou notion of monarchy had been transformed, but the nature and extent of the change was not apparent in the language used. The ‘institutional framework’ was and remained a ‘legalist autocracy’ (Wang and Chang 1986: 12). But the state could now afford to be benevolent. Chinese historians have called it ‘outside Confucian, inside legalist’ (Zhengyuan Fu 1996: 8). As Bodde put it, ‘it is the Legalist/Confucian symbiosis evolved during the Han, with administrative controls at the top merging into self-administered behavioural standards below, that gave to the Chinese state the necessary combination of firmness and flexibility that enabled it to survive’ (CHC i. 90).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>China - Government by Non-Intervention</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;legalism1-and-daoism2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../legalism-overview/&#34;&gt;Legalism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../daoism-overview/&#34;&gt;Daoism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal text: Guanzi (管子)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By being ‘empty and still’, the emperor is supposed to be able to identify the ‘regulatory principles’ of the Dao which operate in both the natural and the human worlds. The &lt;em&gt;Guanzi&lt;/em&gt; insisted that ‘statutes, regulations, and measures be modeled on the Dao’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the right laws, in harmony with the cosmic principles, are in place, then the ruler just has to leave everyone to follow them. The actual business of government is in the hands of the chief minister and bureaucracy. This may be compared to Max Weber&amp;rsquo;s notion of a rule-bound bureaucracy (which he saw as characteristic of a modern state) under a charismatic head. It is bureaucrats who govern while the monarch maintains a ‘mystical link to the cosmic flow’: ‘administration is not his business’ (Lüshi Chunqiu, in ST 237). The ruler does not need to make personal decisions as such. As Shen Bu-Hai first put it, ‘he does not act, yet as a result of his non-action the world brings itself to a state of complete order’ (in Creel 1974: 64).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;entrapped-sovereign&#34;&gt;Entrapped Sovereign&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han Fei shared his predecessors’ view of the ruler as the pivot of sociopolitical order, the sole guarantor of stability and prosperity of his subjects; yet he was also bitterly aware of the ruler’s inadequacy. The very fact that the monarch—unlike his officials—owes his position to pedigree alone means that this position will more often than not be occupied by a mediocrity. Multiple historical examples scattered throughout &lt;em&gt;Han Feizi&lt;/em&gt; unequivocally demonstrate how devastating the ruler’s ineptitude can be. The intrinsic contradiction between an &lt;em&gt;institutionally infallible and humanly erring sovereign&lt;/em&gt; is the major source of tension in the Han Feizi (Pines 2013b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommendations: remain empty and tranquil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruler does not reveal his desires; should he do so, the minister will carve and embellish them. He does not reveal his views; should he do so, the minister will use them to present his different [opinion]. … The way of the enlightened sovereign is to let the knowledgeable completely exhaust their contemplations—then the ruler relies on them to decide on matters and is not depleted of knowledge; to let the worthy utilize their talents—then the ruler relies on them, assigns tasks, and is not depleted of abilities. When there is success, the ruler possesses a worthy [name]; when there is failure, the minister bears the responsibility. (&lt;em&gt;Han Feizi&lt;/em&gt; 5: 27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence the paradox of the entrapped sovereign, who enjoys God-like omnipotence, but who is required to refrain from any activism in order to preserve this omnipotence - a manifestation of the intrinsic contradiction of the authoritarian system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daoism - Overview</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/daoism-overview/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Laozi: Confucius&amp;rsquo;s contemporary. Daoism is authored in 道德经.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laozi proposed a return to primitive simplicity, withdrawal from the world, spontaneity. They thought that society had become overdeveloped, overheated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The more prohibitions and rules, the poorer the people become&amp;hellip; The more elaborate the laws, the more they commit crimes&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corruption and oppression were the inevitable results of civilization and were brought about precisely by those whom others idealized—rulers and sages. In this view, the state is part of the problem, part of humanity’s misguided attempt to control the world. Solutions to human problems are to be sought only in the individual mind. This was the counter-culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monarchy&#34;&gt;Monarchy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Daoists thought that the sage-ruler is himself &amp;lsquo;the unmoving director of the world&amp;rsquo;: his beneficence consists in going with the flow of events, like water flowing downhill; Laozi spoke of a sage-ruler perfectly in tune with Heaven and Earth, and with &amp;lsquo;the hearts and minds of the people&amp;rsquo;. &amp;lsquo;When he acts, he takes no credit&amp;rsquo;, for &amp;lsquo;the people say &amp;ldquo;we did it ourselves&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Legalism - Overview</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/legalism-overview/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A ruler undertakes policies which, even though ‘people do not have the sense to rejoice in them’, are for their long-term benefit (Han Feizi, Basic Writings, 128–9); he ‘does not indulge the people’s desires, he simply looks ahead for what will benefit them’. The ruler may have to enforce his measures ‘against the will of the people’. The goals of the state—prosperity, stability, and expansion—were the only ones which would make life tolerable for the majority of people, and they were ones which people would choose if they could see sufficiently far ahead. This was their justification for compulsory labour, taxation, military service, and severe punishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the reasoning behind the policy, advocated by Shang Yang and
others, and first implemented in the state of Qin, of making punishments
exceptionally severe but predictable. With what would nowadays appear
breathtaking honesty, they advocated rule by fear as the most efficient way of securing the greatest good of the greatest number (Han Feizi, Basic Writings, 104). Only when light offences are ‘regarded as serious’ do ‘serious ones have no chance of coming’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War and killing are permissible so long as the aim is to abolish them. This means achieving what people want by means they do not want (Book of Lord Shang, 230, 285). It is only by going against the wishes of the people that you make them happy. ‘What I call punishment is the basis of righteousness, but what the world calls righteousness is the way of violence’ (Han Feizi, in Wang and Chang 1986: 46). In other words, they were implying that the outcome desired by Confucius could only be achieved by means he refused to contemplate. It simply could not be achieved by persuasion and example (Book of Lord Shang, 325). The true lesson of history was that a great king ‘seized the world by force, but held it by righteousness’—an almost prophetic statement when one looks at the first two dynasties of the Chinese empire.&lt;/p&gt;

Interpretation of the ethical and societal norms of &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt; was the focus of Confucian thought.&lt;/p&gt;

It laid down both the goal and the methods of politics; it stipulated a harmonious society in which the virtuous lead by example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Confucius, government works best when the ruler is humane; the praxis was government by consensus - Heaven looking out from the little people, which enlightened paternalism is needed to lead, teach, and treat well. Persuasion is better than coercion. Confucius saw violence as the break- down of politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confucianism saw the state as a family.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dharma vs Artha; Morality vs Practicality</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/dharma-vs-artha-morality-vs-practicality/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dharma: ethics, duty, morality, virtue, social order
Artha: defined by Kautilya as &amp;ldquo;the subsistence of men&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;land supplied with men&amp;rdquo; - political interest/necessity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conflict-of-morality-and-political-survival&#34;&gt;Conflict of morality and political survival&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A working out of the conflict between dharma and artha, explored in the section of the &lt;em&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/em&gt; known as the &lt;em&gt;Bhagavad Gita&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the eve of the final battle, the god Krishna gave Arjuna a transcendent justification of the doctrine of karma. Arjuna was in a quandary: ‘facing us in the field of battle are teachers, fathers and sons&amp;hellip;These I do not wish to slay, even if I myself am slain’. To this Krishna replies: ‘if any man thinks he slays, and if another thinks he is slain, neither knows the ways of truth. The Eternal in man cannot kill: the Eternal in man cannot die&amp;hellip;But to forgo this fight for righteousness is to forgo thy duty and honour: it is to fall into transgression’ (1: 34–5; 2:19, 33). By doing one’s caste duty here and now, therefore—in Arjuna’s case, as a warrior—whatever the consequences, one will acquire benefits through karma in one’s next life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a unique resolution to the conflict between morality and practicality. It avoids the Machiavellian move of denying the validity of moral norms. It implies a statist sense of duty to the public order comparable to what we find in Roman tradition (where Brutus allows the execution of his own son).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ancient India - Kingship</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/ancient-india-kingship/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 05:59:37 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/ancient-india-kingship/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In ancient Indian theory, caste came first, kingship second. So this was sacred monarchy with a difference. Kingship, though sacred, was not the sole or supreme agency of the divine in society. It is true that &amp;lsquo;in the Vedic period the chief/king assumed identity with various gods during certain state rituals’; he could be regarded as a ‘deva’ with supernatural faculties. A good king could, as in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China, have a beneficial effect on nature and the cosmos. But he was not identified with the supreme god Brahma, nor was he Brahma’s ‘Son or representative’. The fundamental role of sustaining the social order by ritual sacrifice and teaching the Vedas belonged to the brahmins. In the &lt;em&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/em&gt; the relationship was expressed by saying that ‘a brahmin is the root of the tree of Justice; the sovereign prince is its stem and branches; the ministers are its leaves and blossoms; just government is its fruit’ (in Spellman 1964: 124). It is important to note, however, that in the &lt;em&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/em&gt; the good king is generally portrayed as acting quite independently of brahmins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Egyptian and Mesopotamian traditions, the king could intervene in all aspects of social life—he was theoretically omnipotent. In India, kingship functioned alongside, and within, the system of castes. Varna received ‘most of the loyalty elsewhere felt towards king, nation and city’ (Finer 1997: 1211).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Buddhism - Overview</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/buddhism-overview/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two people key to its spread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Siddhartha Gautama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ashoka&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;siddhartha-gautama&#34;&gt;Siddhartha Gautama&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born mid-sixth century BCE in the foothills of the Himalaya Mountains, in what is today southern Nepal, the son of a ruling kshatriya family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a family, left his family, meditated under a tree, achieved enlightenment, spent the rest of his life preaching it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His ideas can be viewed as a reformist form of Brahmanism, designed to transfer responsibility from the priests to the individual, much as the sixteenth century German monk Martin Luther saw his ideas as a reformation of Christianity. Siddhartha accepted the concept of reincarnation and the role of karma as a means of influencing the movement of individual souls up and down the scale of life. Nirvana, the extinction of selfhood and reunion with the Great World Soul, is likened to a dreamless sleep, rather than the Christian concept of heavenly salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four noble truths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life is suffering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suffering is caused by desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way to end suffering is to end desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way to end desire is to avoid the extremes of a life of vulgar materialism and to follow the Middle Path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle Path: right knowledge, purpose, speech, conduct, occupation, effort, awareness, meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All human beings can aspire to Nirvana as a result of their behaviour in this life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siddharta Gautama died in 480 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ashoka&#34;&gt;Ashoka&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converted to Buddhism in the third century BCE, and sent Buddhist missionaries throughout India, and ordered the erection of stone pillars with official edicts and Buddhist inscriptions to instruct people in the proper way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashoka died in 232 BCE, after which the Mauryan empire began to fragment into separate states - in 183 BCE, India reverted to disunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the Rig Vedas, when Brahma, the supreme god, destroyed himself to create the four classes of the society, the &lt;em&gt;brahmins&lt;/em&gt; - the priest class - were made from his head, the &lt;em&gt;kshatriyas&lt;/em&gt; - the warrior, &lt;a href=&#34;../ancient-india-kingship&#34;&gt;king&lt;/a&gt;, administrator class - were made from his arms, the &lt;em&gt;vaishyas&lt;/em&gt; - the merchants - were made from his thighs, and the &lt;em&gt;sudras&lt;/em&gt; - the labourers and servants - came from the feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brahmins, kshatriya, vaishyas, are &lt;em&gt;twice-born&lt;/em&gt; - undergoing a ceremony at puberty whereby they&amp;rsquo;re initiated into adulthood and Indian society.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ancient India State and Religion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Social hierarchy: classical texts specified &lt;em&gt;varna&lt;/em&gt;, a system of four classes in society; this was instantiated into the caste system, &lt;em&gt;jati&lt;/em&gt;, where people are born into a clan (&lt;em&gt;jati&lt;/em&gt;) that specifies social and economic duty, and requirements for endogamy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s thought that this class system was introduced by the Aryans, &lt;a href=&#34;../ancient-india-history/&#34;&gt;when they first arrived in India&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophies that emerged from this background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../brahmanism-overview/&#34;&gt;Brahmanism&lt;/a&gt;, which later developed into Hinduism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../buddhism-overview/&#34;&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of which were underwritten by the concept of &lt;em&gt;karma&lt;/em&gt; - the sum/worth of one&amp;rsquo;s actions in life that decide one&amp;rsquo;s fate in their next life, and in brahmanism, this is accumulated through carrying out &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt; - ethics, duty.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hundred Schools of Thought</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/hundred-schools-of-thought/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2020 23:29:50 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/hundred-schools-of-thought/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Main themes of Chinese political thought: state and monarchy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;state&#34;&gt;State&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature of scholar bureaucrats: 1. as political advisors, working in public service with a rank in the state hierarchy, they had a voice in the formation of the state; 2. as &lt;em&gt;itinerant&lt;/em&gt; political advisors, which gave them leverage and contributed to their intellectual independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In no other culture would the history of thought and the history of the state be so closely intertwined. Ethical and philosophical reflection developed in response to the increasingly problematic political situation. This was the period of ‘a hundred schools’. China produced a greater variety of political ideas than any other monarchical agrarian civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monarchy&#34;&gt;Monarchy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Chinese theories emphasized the need for a single locus of authority, a quasi-absolute monarch, to resolve the problem of human discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-qin-dynasty-inaugurated&#34;&gt;What Qin dynasty inaugurated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than two millennia this imperial government seemed to have a staying-power and a power of self-renewal which one finds in religions—but less often in states—in other parts of the world. In ancient China [&amp;hellip;] ‘political thought’ had a somewhat different function from the equivalent genre elsewhere. It brought together what we in the West divide into the sacred and the secular. Religions such as Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam were similarly based on sacred texts. But these supported a system of belief and practice rather than a system of government. China was the only text-based state.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Professionalization of History</title>

      <guid>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/professionalization-of-history/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The professionalization of history was initiated in nineteenth-century German universities. Leopold von Ranke and his colleagues considered nation building to be the proper subject of history, and they privileged state archives as the appropriate sources for such a project. Eager to claim scientific objectivity, professors carefully policed the boundaries of their masculine, nation-centered discipline and derided any deviations or attempts to write history as literature. Lucy Maynard Salmon, author of the path-breaking social history &lt;em&gt;Domestic Service&lt;/em&gt; (1897), incurred the ridicule of colleagues in analyzing historical recipes and kitchen appliances alongside more traditional documents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By ruthlessly gathering control over the empire into his own hands, Qin Shi Huangdi had hoped to establish a rule that, in the words of the contemporary historian Sima Qian, “would be enjoyed by his sons for ten thousand generations.” In fact, his centralizing zeal alienated many key groups. Landed aristocrats and Confucian intellectuals, as well as the common people, groaned under the censorship of thought and speech, harsh taxes, and forced labor projects. “He killed men,” recounted the historian, “as though he thought he could never finish, he punished men as though he were afraid he would never get around to them all, and the whole world revolted against him.” Shortly after the emperor died in 210 B.C.E., the dynasty quickly descended into factional rivalry, and four years later it was overthrown.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Israelite Political Thinking - Kingship</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Israelite monarchy’s greatest contribution to Jewish political thought was its failure. Military collapse demolished any strong theory of monarchy in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of the Jewish community in exile in Babylon (6th century BCE) reinforced and transformed the sense of their uniqueness as a nation. They became a highly self-conscious community with a new conception of government and politics. The basis of the community was its religion and law. Kingship was now seen as an optional extra, a temporary and accidental feature of public life. In the sacred Jewish scriptures, kingship was presented as an alien graft, not part of the essential Israel, not an instrinsic part of its observance of the Law, nor of its worship of the one true god. They had learned to live, though not by choice—and, they hoped, not for long—as a stateless nation. To what extent they needed any form of governmental authority would be experienced and reflected upon over the ages, by Jews and then by others who associated themselves with this Jewish experience (notably, the early Christians and Shi’ite Muslims). Out of this came also anarchism and communism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Israelite Political Thinking - Exile and Suffering</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The conviction that they had been chosen by the only god that exists went through its most crucial test in the Exile &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;../babylonian-captivity-psalm-137/&#34;&gt;see: lament&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. Conquest and exile interacted with the core Jewish tenet of the chosen people, destined by Yahweh for the lead role among all the peoples of the world. This gave rise to a new genre of prophecy, initiated by Jeremiah even while the monarchical state was in the process of collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What emerged was a consolidation and reinterpretation of what had gone before. [&amp;hellip;] Defeat and suffering were interpreted as divine retribution for moral and legal transgressions, sin codified as central to the divine scheme. They were suffering the consequences of neglecting their side of the covenant with Yahweh. But—and here was the new emphasis—Yahweh was a merciful and wise god: he would use their sin and suffering to teach his people—&lt;em&gt;and through them all human beings&lt;/em&gt;—a new way of thought and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of this [&amp;hellip;came&amp;hellip;] central ideas about the divine nature and the human condition. Defeat and disaster were explained in terms not, as in the Greek historians, of human expectations, interests, and conflicts, but in terms of a divine design for humanity. They created &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; counter-culture of the oppressed, making themselves superior in the divine scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was more than this: Jeremiah prophesied a new covenant in which Yahweh would give the people ‘law within them and write it on their hearts&amp;hellip;No longer need they teach one another to know the Lord; all of them, high and low alike, shall know me’ (Jer. 31: 31–4). This was a revolution within a revolution: it meant, obviously, that every individual Israelite would know Yahweh for himself/herself. The law was internalized. The implication of this for individualism and democracy are prodigious and clear.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Israelite Political Thinking - Covenant and the People</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;gods-relationship-to-the-people&#34;&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s relationship to the people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental relationship was not between god and the king of Israel, but between god and the people of Israel. This was expressed as the covenant, originally between Yahweh and Abraham, including a pledge to his many descendants. I.e. it involved a &lt;em&gt;kinship group or race&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual recipients of the divine covenant are Abraham and Moses: great leaders, but long dead. The agreement with David is not called a ‘covenant’; it seems intended to add material about the state and royal dynasty, rather than as a recapitulation of what everyone knew to be the main body of the covenant, namely the Law. Rather, it was &lt;em&gt;the elders and the people who were the politically active agents at the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main organizing force in Hebrew, and later Jewish, society was the law (ascribed to Yahweh) and the religious worship and ritual it prescribed; this Law had indeed been revealed to a historic leader, but he had transmitted it to the nation as a whole, not to a dynasty or institution. Hence divine legitimacy was bestowed not on the king but on the &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, now positioned as the &lt;em&gt;primary political actor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;peoples-relationship-to-their-king&#34;&gt;People&amp;rsquo;s relationship to their king&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people were portrayed as playing a decisive part in the break-up of the kingdom of Israel and in the appointment of a rival king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was the people of the ten northern tribes of Israel that rejected Solomon&amp;rsquo;s designated heir, Rehoboam, and appointed Solomon&amp;rsquo;s younger son, Jeroboam (previously exiled by his father) as their king when they seceded from Judah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘The men of Israel’ then ‘called [Jeroboam] to the assembly and made him king over the whole of Israel’. This was how Israel seceded from Judah, and from ‘the house of David’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people as compared to the king:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither represent Yahweh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In matters of religious status and observances, the king was on a level with the people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The king could sometimes act as agent of the &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; in a symbolic sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The king could be subjected to criticism for religious irregularities, or for failing to live up to the high standards of justice expected by legal and prophetic traditions.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;yahweh&#34;&gt;Yahweh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So high above all else that no king could claim to represent him - &amp;ldquo;politically unobtrusive&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did not need extravagant gifts which many of these hill people could ill afford anyway - no priestly class was necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideological innovation on this scale was perhaps necessary [&amp;hellip;] to validate their new political identity, which separated them so radically from all other peoples. It enabled them to survive as the type of economic entity which they aspired to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re: Economic entity&lt;br&gt;
The Law stipulated that (rephrased) the &amp;ldquo;means of production (land, herds and flocks)&amp;rdquo; should be owned inalienably by extended families. The Jewish laws &amp;ldquo;inhibited social stratification&amp;rdquo; by eg. prohibiting interest on loans and the sale of land outside the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Neo-Assyrian threat was the whetstone on which the Yahwist prophets sharpened their demands for an exclusive monotheism that went beyond monolatry. Hebrew prophets were practical political leaders as well as religious figures, and most of them understood that military resistance to the Neo-Assyrians was futile. So if the Hebrews were to survive as a people, they had to emphasize the one thing that separated them from everyone else in the known world: the worship of Yahweh and the denial of all other gods. The prophets’ insistence that Yahweh alone should be exalted was thus an aggressive reaction to the equally aggressive promotion of Assur by the Neo-Assyrians.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By the rivers of Babylon, we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There on the poplars we hung our harps,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For there our captors asked us for songs, our tormentors demanded songs of joy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They said, &amp;ldquo;Sing us one of the songs of Zion!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can we sing the songs of the Lord while in a foreign land?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember, O Lord, what the Edomites did on the day Jerusalem fell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tear it down,&amp;rdquo; they cried, &amp;ldquo;tear it down to its foundations!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us&amp;ndash;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../israelites-emergence-as-a-people/&#34;&gt;Israelites emerge as a distinct group of people&lt;/a&gt;, possibly organized in tribes or a league of tribes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingship - first kings: Saul, then David, then Solomon, who built the temple of Jerusalem. After the death of Solomon, tensions between northern and southern tribes in Israel lead to the establishment of two separate kingdoms—the kingdom of Israel, composed of the ten northern tribes, with its capital eventually at Samaria, and the kingdom of Judah, composed of two southern tribes, with its capital at Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;721-722 BCE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assyrians overrun the kingdom of Israel, deporting the ten tribes to the rest of the Assyrian Empire - lost forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;586 BCE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chaldeans defeats Assyria, conquers the kingdom of Judah, destroys Jerusalem. Upper-class people from Jerusalem are deported to Babylon - Psalm 137 is their lament: &lt;a href=&#34;../babylonian-captivity-psalm-137/&#34;&gt;Babylonian Captivity - Psalm 137&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Babylon falls to Persian empire. The Persians destroy the Chaldean kingdom and allow the people of Judah to return to Jerusalem and rebuild their city and Temple. The revived kingdom of Judah remains under Persian control until the conquests of Alexander the Great in the fourth century B.C.E.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Never in Mesopotamia was his relationship with god so close as in Egypt; no Mesopotamian king was deified. In both cultures the image of the king as shepherd of the people was developed. The king’s duty to implement justice, especially by fair adjudication between the powerful and the weak, was emphasized in both cultures, perhaps more insistently in Egypt. The most striking contrast was the judicial and, occasionally, political role of citizens in Mesopotamia, and the complete absence of such popular participation in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the language and concepts used, it seems clear that the gods had established not just individual rulers but an institution, with specific functions, which would outlast individual rulers—we can call this a state. It was symbolized by &lt;em&gt;‘sceptre, tiara and [shepherd’s] crook’&lt;/em&gt;; these ‘lay deposited before Anu in heaven’ before ‘kingship descended from heaven’. Among the fundamental cosmic and cultural essences were &lt;em&gt;‘the exalted and enduring crown, the throne of kingship, the exalted scepter, the royal insignia, the exalted shrine, shepherd-ship, kingship’&lt;/em&gt;. Kingship was bala; that is, ‘return or reversion to origin’, or ‘term of office’. This sounds like the prototype of the Irano-Islamic notion of the state (dawla). Thus, it seems, theology led, or enabled, people to formulate the abstract concept of an authority that would transcend the vagaries and misfortunes of individual monarchs, and so provide a more effective political instrument for human survival and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Egypt the king was more closely identified with the gods than in any other culture. He was the incarnation of Horus and Osiris, the son of the supreme god Ra himself. He was the supreme representative of the religious as well as the political order. The king’s relationship to his subjects was thus also a spiritual relationship; the great god Ptah was in all living beings, so that the king was connected to the life-force (ka) of every individual. The king was revered as ‘greatest god’, the ‘perfect god’; he was said to have been conceived when Amun desired a royal wife, ‘the god’s wife’. The pharaoh ruled even over the netherworld as Osiris and ‘deceased father’. He was credited with the power of divine ‘utterance’, his word ‘became a reality immediately’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the Egyptians who introduced the metaphor of the king as shepherd into political thought. What they meant was that, just as a landowner entrusts his sheep to a shepherd, the god transmitted his authority and responsibility to the king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;kings-may-use-religion-but-they-cannot-invent-it&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kings may use religion, but they cannot invent it&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of religious monarchy in Egypt was brought to a strange climax in an attempted religious revolution by Amenhotep IV (1350–1334 BCE). He proclaimed the Aten (sun-disc) as sole god, and proclaimed himself the son of the Aten. He abolished the festivals and processions of all other gods, including the supreme Amun, systematically destroying their images, monuments, and inscriptions. The capital was transferred to a new city, Amarna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also the first documented attempt to impose belief on a population by force. It did not outlast Amenhotep himself; the traditional religion was promptly restored. The memory of Amarna was so hated, and all traces of it so effectively obliterated, that the whole episode has only recently come to light. The priests eventually exercised their own kind of theocracy, with the high-priest acting on behalf of Amun. The god was now regarded as the real king. This was related to a growing belief that the god communicated important political decisions through oracles. By the time of Alexander’s conquest of Egypt in 331 BCE, ‘the Egyptian kingship faded into mere theory’.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Egypt - Middle Kingdom</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Middle Kingdom: 2010 - 1630 BCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12th to 13th dynasties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Middle Kingdom was characterized by a new concern of the pharaohs for the people. In the Old Kingdom, the pharaoh had been viewed as an inaccessible god-king. Now he was portrayed as the shepherd of his people with the responsibility to build public works and provide for the public welfare. Pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom undertook a number of helpful projects, such as draining the swampland in the Nile Delta to provide thousands of acres of new farmland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Middle Kingdom came to an end around 1630 B.C.E. with the invasion of Egypt by a people from western Asia known to the Egyptians as the Hyksos. The Hyksos used horse-drawn war chariots and overwhelmed the Egyptian soldiers, who fought from donkey carts. For almost a hundred years, the Hyksos ruled much of Egypt, but the conquered took much from their conquerors. From the Hyksos, the Egyptians learned to use bronze in making new farming tools and weapons. They also mastered the military skills of the Hyksos, especially the use of horse-drawn war chariots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, a new line of pharaohs—the eighteenth dynasty—made use of the new weapons to throw off Hyksos domination, reunite Egypt, establish the New Kingdom, and launch the Egyptians along a new militaristic path. During the period of the New Kingdom, Egypt created an empire and became the most powerful state in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Old Kingdom: 2575 - 2125 BCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4th to 8th dynasties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the fourth dynasty, a bureaucracy with regular procedures had developed. In time, Egypt was divided into provinces or nomes, as they were later called by the Greeks—twenty-two in Upper Egypt and twenty in Lower Egypt. A governor, called a nomarch by the Greeks, was head of each nome and was responsible to the king.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Egypt - New Kingdom</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the period of the New Kingdom, Egypt created an empire and became the most powerful state in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Kingdom: 1539 - 1069 BCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18th to 20th dynasties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The power of the New Kingdom pharaohs was aided by massive wealth, which they showed by building new temples. Queen Hatshepsut (ca. 1503–1480 B.C.E.), one of the first women to become pharaoh in her own right, built a great temple at Deir el Bahri near Thebes. Hatshepsut was succeeded by her nephew, Thutmosis III (ca. 1480–1450 B.C.E.), who led seventeen military campaigns into Syria and Canaan and even reached the Euphrates River. Egyptian forces occupied Canaan and Syria and also moved westward into Libya.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amenhotep IV (1364 - 1347 BCE) and his wife Nefertiti introduced the worship of Aten, god of the sun disk, as the supreme god and later in his reign as the only god. He changed his name to Akhenaten (servant of Aten). Akhenaten’s preoccupation with his religious revolution caused him to ignore foreign affairs and led to the loss of both Syria and Canaan. Akhenaten’s changes were soon undone after his death by the boy-pharaoh Tutankhamun, who restored the old gods. The eighteenth dynasty soon came to an end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nineteenth dynasty managed to restore Egyptian power one more time. Under Ramesses II (ca. 1279–1213 B.C.E.), the Egyptians regained control of Canaan, but new invasions in the thirteenth century by the “Sea Peoples,” as the Egyptians called them, destroyed Egyptian power in Canaan and drove the Egyptians back within their old frontiers. The days of Egyptian empire were ended, and the New Kingdom itself expired with the end of the twentieth dynasty in 1069 B.C.E. For the next thousand years, despite periodic revivals of strength, Egypt was dominated by Libyans, Nubians, Persians, and finally Macedonians after the conquest of Alexander the Great. In the first century B.C.E., Egypt became a province in Rome’s mighty empire.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Mesopotamian religion - 2nd millenium BCE</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/mesopotamian-religion-2nd-millenium-bce/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd millenium BCE – guilt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Personification of a man’s luck and ability to effectively think and act is identified with some known figure of the pantheon, usually a minor deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumerian composition: “Man and his God”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man complains that what he knows does not come out right, what he says quite truthfully turns out to be false, he does things in all innocence and finds that he has been duped into committing wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His god – his powers of clear and fast thinking – is not there to suggest an answer when friends deceive him, or when evil-doers abuse him; his god has abandoned him and lost interest in him&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realization: blame lies with himself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plead: no man is perfect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He asks to be shown his faults, his transgressions, that he may confess them before his god and be forgiven; God is moved by his contrition and takes him back into favour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insight gained in the preceding millennium that the divine stands for, and upholds, a moral law -&amp;gt; is now bearing fruit in a realization of individual human responsibility, but also of innate human inability to live up to that responsibility&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd millenium BCE – the sword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As the settled areas of the country grew and joined, the protection that had been afforded by relative isolation was no longer there and fear of enemy attack, death or slavery, became a part of life ever present in the depth of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rise of great city-walls that around the towns in this period - the staggering amount of labor that must have gone into them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a shield against danger men looked to the now vitally important institutions of collective security, the great leagues and their officers, and particularly to the new institution of kingship as it took form and grew under the pressures of these years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gods, seen as kings and rulers, were no longer powers in nature only, they became powers in human affairs – in history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4th millenium BCE – famine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The powers to whom they turned were powers in and behind their primary economics on which life depended: fishing, herding, agriculture, as even the briefest look at the character of the chief gods of their cities will show. Aim and purpose of their cults were to insure the presence of these essential powers for fertility produce, and food. Houses – temples – were built for them so that they might dwell with men as members of the human community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i.e. ziggurats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this seems to be true of egyptian temples as well&lt;/li&gt;
