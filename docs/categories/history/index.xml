      <title>Transnational Diplomacy and Trade in 14th Century BCE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Region: West Asia and Mediterranean
Time: 14th century BCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This Late Bronze Age was an age of superpowers. The great pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty had transformed Egypt into a conquering state, and the Hittites had created an empire out of the disparate city-states and kingdoms of Anatolia. The Assyrian controlled Near Eastern trade, and the Kassite kingdom of Babylonia remained a significant force in economic and military relationships. In addition to these imperial entities, numerous smaller states also flourished and extended their influence westward into the Mediterranean. Holding it all together was a network of trade routes that created an interdependent Afro-Eurasian world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;other lavish gifts (greeting gifts for festivals and such)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence of transnational trade&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egyptians delighted in Canaanite glass, Greeks prized Egyptian amu- lets, and the merchants of Syria admired Greek pottery and wool.
This was the background for the development of the abjad (the consonant-only family of alphabet later giving rise to the Phoenician alphabet). Ugarit, on the coast of modern-day Syria, developed the Ugaritic alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Li, in Confucianism, is a formalization of the philosophy behind the clearly sanctioned rules and behaviour that underpin Asian societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High yields have always supported large populations in monsoon Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states and empires of monsoon Asia were built consistently on their common peasant base of intensive, high-yield agriculture, which provided the great bulk of revenues, the manpower for armies, and the highly structured social order. [&amp;hellip;] The village worlds were largely self-governing and self-regulating, thanks to the family system, the kin network, and the basic social institutions common to the area as a whole, but they formed the essential foundation for the building and maintenance of empires.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Background: unification and centralization by Qin provided a milieu in which the gentlemanly culture of Confucianism could flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han Confucianism was thus a conflation of earlier Confucianism, mystical cosmology, and authoritarian statism (CHC i. 107, 652). The Zhou notion of monarchy had been transformed, but the nature and extent of the change was not apparent in the language used. The ‘institutional framework’ was and remained a ‘legalist autocracy’ (Wang and Chang 1986: 12). But the state could now afford to be benevolent. Chinese historians have called it ‘outside Confucian, inside legalist’ (Zhengyuan Fu 1996: 8). As Bodde put it, ‘it is the Legalist/Confucian symbiosis evolved during the Han, with administrative controls at the top merging into self-administered behavioural standards below, that gave to the Chinese state the necessary combination of firmness and flexibility that enabled it to survive’ (CHC i. 90).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>China - Government by Non-Intervention</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/china-government-by-non-intervention/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;legalism1-and-daoism2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../legalism-overview/&#34;&gt;Legalism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../daoism-overview/&#34;&gt;Daoism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal text: Guanzi (管子)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By being ‘empty and still’, the emperor is supposed to be able to identify the ‘regulatory principles’ of the Dao which operate in both the natural and the human worlds. The &lt;em&gt;Guanzi&lt;/em&gt; insisted that ‘statutes, regulations, and measures be modeled on the Dao’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the right laws, in harmony with the cosmic principles, are in place, then the ruler just has to leave everyone to follow them. The actual business of government is in the hands of the chief minister and bureaucracy. This may be compared to Max Weber&amp;rsquo;s notion of a rule-bound bureaucracy (which he saw as characteristic of a modern state) under a charismatic head. It is bureaucrats who govern while the monarch maintains a ‘mystical link to the cosmic flow’: ‘administration is not his business’ (Lüshi Chunqiu, in ST 237). The ruler does not need to make personal decisions as such. As Shen Bu-Hai first put it, ‘he does not act, yet as a result of his non-action the world brings itself to a state of complete order’ (in Creel 1974: 64).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;entrapped-sovereign&#34;&gt;Entrapped Sovereign&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han Fei shared his predecessors’ view of the ruler as the pivot of sociopolitical order, the sole guarantor of stability and prosperity of his subjects; yet he was also bitterly aware of the ruler’s inadequacy. The very fact that the monarch—unlike his officials—owes his position to pedigree alone means that this position will more often than not be occupied by a mediocrity. Multiple historical examples scattered throughout &lt;em&gt;Han Feizi&lt;/em&gt; unequivocally demonstrate how devastating the ruler’s ineptitude can be. The intrinsic contradiction between an &lt;em&gt;institutionally infallible and humanly erring sovereign&lt;/em&gt; is the major source of tension in the Han Feizi (Pines 2013b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommendations: remain empty and tranquil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruler does not reveal his desires; should he do so, the minister will carve and embellish them. He does not reveal his views; should he do so, the minister will use them to present his different [opinion]. … The way of the enlightened sovereign is to let the knowledgeable completely exhaust their contemplations—then the ruler relies on them to decide on matters and is not depleted of knowledge; to let the worthy utilize their talents—then the ruler relies on them, assigns tasks, and is not depleted of abilities. When there is success, the ruler possesses a worthy [name]; when there is failure, the minister bears the responsibility. (&lt;em&gt;Han Feizi&lt;/em&gt; 5: 27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence the paradox of the entrapped sovereign, who enjoys God-like omnipotence, but who is required to refrain from any activism in order to preserve this omnipotence - a manifestation of the intrinsic contradiction of the authoritarian system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daoism - Overview</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/daoism-overview/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Laozi: Confucius&amp;rsquo;s contemporary. Daoism is authored in 道德经.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laozi proposed a return to primitive simplicity, withdrawal from the world, spontaneity. They thought that society had become overdeveloped, overheated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The more prohibitions and rules, the poorer the people become&amp;hellip; The more elaborate the laws, the more they commit crimes&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corruption and oppression were the inevitable results of civilization and were brought about precisely by those whom others idealized—rulers and sages. In this view, the state is part of the problem, part of humanity’s misguided attempt to control the world. Solutions to human problems are to be sought only in the individual mind. This was the counter-culture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monarchy&#34;&gt;Monarchy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Daoists thought that the sage-ruler is himself &amp;lsquo;the unmoving director of the world&amp;rsquo;: his beneficence consists in going with the flow of events, like water flowing downhill; Laozi spoke of a sage-ruler perfectly in tune with Heaven and Earth, and with &amp;lsquo;the hearts and minds of the people&amp;rsquo;. &amp;lsquo;When he acts, he takes no credit&amp;rsquo;, for &amp;lsquo;the people say &amp;ldquo;we did it ourselves&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Legalism - Overview</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/legalism-overview/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A ruler undertakes policies which, even though ‘people do not have the sense to rejoice in them’, are for their long-term benefit (Han Feizi, Basic Writings, 128–9); he ‘does not indulge the people’s desires, he simply looks ahead for what will benefit them’. The ruler may have to enforce his measures ‘against the will of the people’. The goals of the state—prosperity, stability, and expansion—were the only ones which would make life tolerable for the majority of people, and they were ones which people would choose if they could see sufficiently far ahead. This was their justification for compulsory labour, taxation, military service, and severe punishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the reasoning behind the policy, advocated by Shang Yang and
others, and first implemented in the state of Qin, of making punishments
exceptionally severe but predictable. With what would nowadays appear
breathtaking honesty, they advocated rule by fear as the most efficient way of securing the greatest good of the greatest number (Han Feizi, Basic Writings, 104). Only when light offences are ‘regarded as serious’ do ‘serious ones have no chance of coming’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War and killing are permissible so long as the aim is to abolish them. This means achieving what people want by means they do not want (Book of Lord Shang, 230, 285). It is only by going against the wishes of the people that you make them happy. ‘What I call punishment is the basis of righteousness, but what the world calls righteousness is the way of violence’ (Han Feizi, in Wang and Chang 1986: 46). In other words, they were implying that the outcome desired by Confucius could only be achieved by means he refused to contem- plate. It simply could not be achieved by persuasion and example (Book of Lord Shang, 325). The true lesson of history was that a great king ‘seized the world by force, but held it by righteousness’—an almost prophetic statement when one looks at the first two dynasties of the Chinese empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Li&lt;/em&gt;: ritual, custom, decorum, propriety, ethics - a concept extended from a code of conduct and traditional conventions of social intercourse to embrace a &amp;ldquo;broad range of political activities, such as personnel policy, [and] proper handling of rewards and punishments&amp;rdquo;, so that it came to comprise the &amp;ldquo;entire way of governing&amp;rdquo;. Interpretation of the ethical and societal norms of &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt; was the focus of Confucian thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ren&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;lsquo;to overcome the self and turn to &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt;. The inner rationale that motivates people to observe &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt;. The humaneness that legitimizes political order (as interpreted by Mengzi, Confucius&amp;rsquo;s disciple). Confucius insisted that humaneness was the fundamental norm not only ofhuman conduct, but of political conduct and civilized government. It laid down both the goal and the methods of politics; it stipulated a harmonious society in which the virtuous lead by example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Confucius, government works best when the ruler is humane; the praxis was government by consensus - Heaven looking out from the little people, which enlightened paternalism is needed to lead, teach, and treat well. Persuasion is better than coercion. Confucius saw violence as the break- down of politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confucianism saw the state as a family.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ancient India - Kingship</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/ancient-india-kingship/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 05:59:37 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/ancient-india-kingship/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In ancient Indian theory, caste came first, kingship second. So this was sacred monarchy with a difference. Kingship, though sacred, was not the sole or supreme agency of the divine in society. It is true that &amp;lsquo;in the Vedic period the chief/king assumed identity with various gods during certain state rituals’; he could be regarded as a ‘deva’ with supernatural faculties. A good king could, as in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China, have a beneficial effect on nature and the cosmos. But he was not identified with the supreme god Brahma, nor was he Brahma’s ‘Son or representative’. The fundamental role of sustaining the social order by ritual sacrifice and teaching the Vedas belonged to the brahmins. In the &lt;em&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/em&gt; the relationship was expressed by saying that ‘a brahmin is the root of the tree of Justice; the sovereign prince is its stem and branches; the ministers are its leaves and blossoms; just government is its fruit’ (in Spellman 1964: 124). It is important to note, however, that in the &lt;em&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/em&gt; the good king is generally portrayed as acting quite independently of brahmins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Egyptian and Mesopotamian traditions, the king could intervene in all aspects of social life—he was theoretically omnipotent. In India, kingship functioned alongside, and within, the system of castes. Varna received ‘most of the loyalty elsewhere felt towards king, nation and city’ (Finer 1997: 1211).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Social hierarchy: classical texts specified &lt;em&gt;varna&lt;/em&gt;, a system of four classes in society; this was instantiated into the caste system, &lt;em&gt;jati&lt;/em&gt;, where people are born into a clan (&lt;em&gt;jati&lt;/em&gt;) that specifies social and economic duty, and requirements for endogamy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s thought that this class system was introduced by the Aryans, &lt;a href=&#34;../ancient-india-history/&#34;&gt;when they first arrived in India&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of which were underwritten by the concept of &lt;em&gt;karma&lt;/em&gt; - the sum/worth of one&amp;rsquo;s actions in life that decide one&amp;rsquo;s fate in their next life, and in brahmanism, this is accumulated through carrying out &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt; - ethics, duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nature of scholar bureaucrats: 1. as political advisors, working in public service with a rank in the state hierarchy, they had a voice in the formation of the state; 2. as &lt;em&gt;itinerant&lt;/em&gt; political advisors, which gave them leverage and contributed to their intellectual independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In no other culture would the history of thought and the history of the state be so closely intertwined. Ethical and philosophical reflection developed in response to the increasingly problematic political situation. This was the period of ‘a hundred schools’. China produced a greater variety of political ideas than any other monarchical agrarian civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monarchy&#34;&gt;Monarchy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Chinese theories emphasized the need for a single locus of authority, a quasi-absolute monarch, to resolve the problem of human discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-qin-dynasty-inaugurated&#34;&gt;What Qin dynasty inaugurated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than two millennia this imperial government seemed to have a staying-power and a power of self-renewal which one finds in religions—but less often in states—in other parts of the world. In ancient China [&amp;hellip;] ‘political thought’ had a somewhat different function from the equivalent genre elsewhere. It brought together what we in the West divide into the sacred and the secular. Religions such as Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam were similarly based on sacred texts. But these supported a system of belief and practice rather than a system of government. China was the only text-based state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Han armies marched westward as far as the Caspian Sea, pacifying nomadic peoples and extending China&amp;rsquo;s boundary far into Central Asia, &lt;em&gt;originally to seek alliance to counter the common Xiongnu menace&lt;/em&gt;, but thereafter &lt;em&gt;Chinese commercial exchanges with people in Central Asia began to expand dramatically.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By ruthlessly gathering control over the empire into his own hands, Qin Shi Huangdi had hoped to establish a rule that, in the words of the contemporary historian Sima Qian, “would be enjoyed by his sons for ten thousand generations.” In fact, his centralizing zeal alienated many key groups. Landed aristocrats and Confucian intellectuals, as well as the common people, groaned under the censorship of thought and speech, harsh taxes, and forced labor projects. “He killed men,” recounted the historian, “as though he thought he could never finish, he punished men as though he were afraid he would never get around to them all, and the whole world revolted against him.” Shortly after the emperor died in 210 B.C.E., the dynasty quickly descended into factional rivalry, and four years later it was overthrown.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By the rivers of Babylon, we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There on the poplars we hung our harps,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For there our captors asked us for songs, our tormentors demanded songs of joy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They said, &amp;ldquo;Sing us one of the songs of Zion!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can we sing the songs of the Lord while in a foreign land?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember, O Lord, what the Edomites did on the day Jerusalem fell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tear it down,&amp;rdquo; they cried, &amp;ldquo;tear it down to its foundations!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us&amp;ndash;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingship - first kings: Saul, then David, then Solomon, who built the temple of Jerusalem. After the death of Solomon, tensions between northern and southern tribes in Israel lead to the establishment of two separate kingdoms—the kingdom of Israel, composed of the ten northern tribes, with its capital eventually at Samaria, and the kingdom of Judah, composed of two southern tribes, with its capital at Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;721-722 BCE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assyrians overrun the kingdom of Israel, deporting the ten tribes to the rest of the Assyrian Empire - lost forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;586 BCE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chaldeans defeats Assyria, conquers the kingdom of Judah, destroys Jerusalem. Upper-class people from Jerusalem are deported to Babylon - Psalm 137 is their lament: &lt;a href=&#34;../babylonian-captivity-psalm-137/&#34;&gt;Babylonian Captivity - Psalm 137&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the language and concepts used, it seems clear that the gods had established not just individual rulers but an institution, with specific functions, which would outlast individual rulers—we can call this a state. It was symbolized by &lt;em&gt;‘sceptre, tiara and [shepherd’s] crook’&lt;/em&gt;; these ‘lay deposited before Anu in heaven’ before ‘kingship descended from heaven’. Among the fundamental cosmic and cultural essences were &lt;em&gt;‘the exalted and enduring crown, the throne of kingship, the exalted scepter, the royal insignia, the exalted shrine, shepherd-ship, kingship’&lt;/em&gt;. Kingship was bala; that is, ‘return or reversion to origin’, or ‘term of office’. This sounds like the prototype of the Irano-Islamic notion of the state (dawla). Thus, it seems, theology led, or enabled, people to formulate the abstract concept of an authority that would transcend the vagaries and misfortunes of individual monarchs, and so provide a more effective political instrument for human survival and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Egypt - Middle Kingdom</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/egypt-middle-kingdom/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2020 06:32:18 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Middle Kingdom: 2010 - 1630 BCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12th to 13th dynasties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Middle Kingdom was characterized by a new concern of the pharaohs for the people. In the Old Kingdom, the pharaoh had been viewed as an inaccessible god-king. Now he was portrayed as the shepherd of his people with the responsibility to build public works and provide for the public welfare. Pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom undertook a number of helpful projects, such as draining the swampland in the Nile Delta to provide thousands of acres of new farmland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Middle Kingdom came to an end around 1630 B.C.E. with the invasion of Egypt by a people from western Asia known to the Egyptians as the Hyksos. The Hyksos used horse-drawn war chariots and overwhelmed the Egyptian soldiers, who fought from donkey carts. For almost a hundred years, the Hyksos ruled much of Egypt, but the conquered took much from their conquerors. From the Hyksos, the Egyptians learned to use bronze in making new farming tools and weapons. They also mastered the military skills of the Hyksos, especially the use of horse-drawn war chariots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, a new line of pharaohs—the eighteenth dynasty—made use of the new weapons to throw off Hyksos domination, reunite Egypt, establish the New Kingdom, and launch the Egyptians along a new militaristic path. During the period of the New Kingdom, Egypt created an empire and became the most powerful state in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4th to 8th dynasties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the fourth dynasty, a bureaucracy with regular procedures had developed. In time, Egypt was divided into provinces or nomes, as they were later called by the Greeks—twenty-two in Upper Egypt and twenty in Lower Egypt. A governor, called a nomarch by the Greeks, was head of each nome and was responsible to the king.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the period of the New Kingdom, Egypt created an empire and became the most powerful state in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Kingdom: 1539 - 1069 BCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18th to 20th dynasties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The power of the New Kingdom pharaohs was aided by massive wealth, which they showed by building new temples. Queen Hatshepsut (ca. 1503–1480 B.C.E.), one of the first women to become pharaoh in her own right, built a great temple at Deir el Bahri near Thebes. Hatshepsut was succeeded by her nephew, Thutmosis III (ca. 1480–1450 B.C.E.), who led seventeen military campaigns into Syria and Canaan and even reached the Euphrates River. Egyptian forces occupied Canaan and Syria and also moved westward into Libya.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amenhotep IV (1364 - 1347 BCE) and his wife Nefertiti introduced the worship of Aten, god of the sun disk, as the supreme god and later in his reign as the only god. He changed his name to Akhenaten (servant of Aten). Akhenaten’s preoccupation with his religious revolution caused him to ignore foreign affairs and led to the loss of both Syria and Canaan. Akhenaten’s changes were soon undone after his death by the boy-pharaoh Tutankhamun, who restored the old gods. The eighteenth dynasty soon came to an end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nineteenth dynasty managed to restore Egyptian power one more time. Under Ramesses II (ca. 1279–1213 B.C.E.), the Egyptians regained control of Canaan, but new invasions in the thirteenth century by the “Sea Peoples,” as the Egyptians called them, destroyed Egyptian power in Canaan and drove the Egyptians back within their old frontiers. The days of Egyptian empire were ended, and the New Kingdom itself expired with the end of the twentieth dynasty in 1069 B.C.E. For the next thousand years, despite periodic revivals of strength, Egypt was dominated by Libyans, Nubians, Persians, and finally Macedonians after the conquest of Alexander the Great. In the first century B.C.E., Egypt became a province in Rome’s mighty empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd millenium BCE – guilt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Personification of a man’s luck and ability to effectively think and act is identified with some known figure of the pantheon, usually a minor deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumerian composition: “Man and his God”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man complains that what he knows does not come out right, what he says quite truthfully turns out to be false, he does things in all innocence and finds that he has been duped into committing wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His god – his powers of clear and fast thinking – is not there to suggest an answer when friends deceive him, or when evil-doers abuse him; his god has abandoned him and lost interest in him&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realization: blame lies with himself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plead: no man is perfect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He asks to be shown his faults, his transgressions, that he may confess them before his god and be forgiven; God is moved by his contrition and takes him back into favour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insight gained in the preceding millennium that the divine stands for, and upholds, a moral law -&amp;gt; is now bearing fruit in a realization of individual human responsibility, but also of innate human inability to live up to that responsibility&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd millenium BCE – the sword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As the settled areas of the country grew and joined, the protection that had been afforded by relative isolation was no longer there and fear of enemy attack, death or slavery, became a part of life ever present in the depth of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rise of great city-walls that around the towns in this period - the staggering amount of labor that must have gone into them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a shield against danger men looked to the now vitally important institutions of collective security, the great leagues and their officers, and particularly to the new institution of kingship as it took form and grew under the pressures of these years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gods, seen as kings and rulers, were no longer powers in nature only, they became powers in human affairs – in history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4th millenium BCE – famine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The powers to whom they turned were powers in and behind their primary economics on which life depended: fishing, herding, agriculture, as even the briefest look at the character of the chief gods of their cities will show. Aim and purpose of their cults were to insure the presence of these essential powers for fertility produce, and food. Houses – temples – were built for them so that they might dwell with men as members of the human community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i.e. ziggurats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this seems to be true of egyptian temples as well&lt;/li&gt;
