      <title>Mesopotamian vs Egyptian Kingship</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Never in Mesopotamia was his relationship with god so close as in Egypt; no Mesopotamian king was deified. In both cultures the image of the king as shepherd of the people was developed. The king’s duty to implement justice, especially by fair adjudication between the powerful and the weak, was emphasized in both cultures, perhaps more insistently in Egypt. The most striking contrast was the judicial and, occasionally, political role of citizens in Mesopotamia, and the complete absence of such popular participation in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Egypt - State and Religion</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;pharaoh-god-king&#34;&gt;Pharaoh, god-king&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Egypt the king was more closely identified with the gods than in any other culture. He was the incarnation of Horus and Osiris, the son of the supreme god Ra himself. He was the supreme representative of the religious as well as the political order. The king’s relationship to his subjects was thus also a spiritual relationship; the great god Ptah was in all living beings, so that the king was connected to the life-force (ka) of every individual. The king was revered as ‘greatest god’, the ‘perfect god’; he was said to have been conceived when Amun desired a royal wife, ‘the god’s wife’. The pharaoh ruled even over the netherworld as Osiris and ‘deceased father’. He was credited with the power of divine ‘utterance’, his word ‘became a reality immediately’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pharaoh-shephard&#34;&gt;Pharaoh, shephard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the Egyptians who introduced the metaphor of the king as shepherd into political thought. What they meant was that, just as a landowner entrusts his sheep to a shepherd, the god transmitted his authority and responsibility to the king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;kings-may-use-religion-but-they-cannot-invent-it&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kings may use religion, but they cannot invent it&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of religious monarchy in Egypt was brought to a strange climax in an attempted religious revolution by Amenhotep IV (1350–1334 BCE). He proclaimed the Aten (sun-disc) as sole god, and proclaimed himself the son of the Aten. He abolished the festivals and processions of all other gods, including the supreme Amun, systematically destroying their images, monuments, and inscriptions. The capital was transferred to a new city, Amarna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also the first documented attempt to impose belief on a population by force. It did not outlast Amenhotep himself; the traditional religion was promptly restored. The memory of Amarna was so hated, and all traces of it so effectively obliterated, that the whole episode has only recently come to light. The priests eventually exercised their own kind of theocracy, with the high-priest acting on behalf of Amun. The god was now regarded as the real king. This was related to a growing belief that the god communicated important political decisions through oracles. By the time of Alexander’s conquest of Egypt in 331 BCE, ‘the Egyptian kingship faded into mere theory’.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Egypt - Middle Kingdom</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/egypt-middle-kingdom/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Middle Kingdom: 2010 - 1630 BCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12th to 13th dynasties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Middle Kingdom was characterized by a new concern of the pharaohs for the people. In the Old Kingdom, the pharaoh had been viewed as an inaccessible god-king. Now he was portrayed as the shepherd of his people with the responsibility to build public works and provide for the public welfare. Pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom undertook a number of helpful projects, such as draining the swampland in the Nile Delta to provide thousands of acres of new farmland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Middle Kingdom came to an end around 1630 B.C.E. with the invasion of Egypt by a people from western Asia known to the Egyptians as the Hyksos. The Hyksos used horse-drawn war chariots and overwhelmed the Egyptian soldiers, who fought from donkey carts. For almost a hundred years, the Hyksos ruled much of Egypt, but the conquered took much from their conquerors. From the Hyksos, the Egyptians learned to use bronze in making new farming tools and weapons. They also mastered the military skills of the Hyksos, especially the use of horse-drawn war chariots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, a new line of pharaohs—the eighteenth dynasty—made use of the new weapons to throw off Hyksos domination, reunite Egypt, establish the New Kingdom, and launch the Egyptians along a new militaristic path. During the period of the New Kingdom, Egypt created an empire and became the most powerful state in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Old Kingdom: 2575 - 2125 BCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4th to 8th dynasties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the fourth dynasty, a bureaucracy with regular procedures had developed. In time, Egypt was divided into provinces or nomes, as they were later called by the Greeks—twenty-two in Upper Egypt and twenty in Lower Egypt. A governor, called a nomarch by the Greeks, was head of each nome and was responsible to the king.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Egypt - New Kingdom</title>
      <link>https://bathrobe-enthusiast.github.io/notes/posts/egypt-new-kingdom/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the period of the New Kingdom, Egypt created an empire and became the most powerful state in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Kingdom: 1539 - 1069 BCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18th to 20th dynasties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The power of the New Kingdom pharaohs was aided by massive wealth, which they showed by building new temples. Queen Hatshepsut (ca. 1503–1480 B.C.E.), one of the first women to become pharaoh in her own right, built a great temple at Deir el Bahri near Thebes. Hatshepsut was succeeded by her nephew, Thutmosis III (ca. 1480–1450 B.C.E.), who led seventeen military campaigns into Syria and Canaan and even reached the Euphrates River. Egyptian forces occupied Canaan and Syria and also moved westward into Libya.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amenhotep IV (1364 - 1347 BCE) and his wife Nefertiti introduced the worship of Aten, god of the sun disk, as the supreme god and later in his reign as the only god. He changed his name to Akhenaten (servant of Aten). Akhenaten’s preoccupation with his religious revolution caused him to ignore foreign affairs and led to the loss of both Syria and Canaan. Akhenaten’s changes were soon undone after his death by the boy-pharaoh Tutankhamun, who restored the old gods. The eighteenth dynasty soon came to an end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nineteenth dynasty managed to restore Egyptian power one more time. Under Ramesses II (ca. 1279–1213 B.C.E.), the Egyptians regained control of Canaan, but new invasions in the thirteenth century by the “Sea Peoples,” as the Egyptians called them, destroyed Egyptian power in Canaan and drove the Egyptians back within their old frontiers. The days of Egyptian empire were ended, and the New Kingdom itself expired with the end of the twentieth dynasty in 1069 B.C.E. For the next thousand years, despite periodic revivals of strength, Egypt was dominated by Libyans, Nubians, Persians, and finally Macedonians after the conquest of Alexander the Great. In the first century B.C.E., Egypt became a province in Rome’s mighty empire.&lt;/li&gt;
