      <title>Mesopotamian vs Egyptian Kingship</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Never in Mesopotamia was his relationship with god so close as in Egypt; no Mesopotamian king was deified. In both cultures the image of the king as shepherd of the people was developed. The king’s duty to implement justice, especially by fair adjudication between the powerful and the weak, was emphasized in both cultures, perhaps more insistently in Egypt. The most striking contrast was the judicial and, occasionally, political role of citizens in Mesopotamia, and the complete absence of such popular participation in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the language and concepts used, it seems clear that the gods had established not just individual rulers but an institution, with specific functions, which would outlast individual rulers—we can call this a state. It was symbolized by &lt;em&gt;‘sceptre, tiara and [shepherd’s] crook’&lt;/em&gt;; these ‘lay deposited before Anu in heaven’ before ‘kingship descended from heaven’. Among the fundamental cosmic and cultural essences were &lt;em&gt;‘the exalted and enduring crown, the throne of kingship, the exalted scepter, the royal insignia, the exalted shrine, shepherd-ship, kingship’&lt;/em&gt;. Kingship was bala; that is, ‘return or reversion to origin’, or ‘term of office’. This sounds like the prototype of the Irano-Islamic notion of the state (dawla). Thus, it seems, theology led, or enabled, people to formulate the abstract concept of an authority that would transcend the vagaries and misfortunes of individual monarchs, and so provide a more effective political instrument for human survival and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesopotamian religion - 2nd millenium BCE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd millenium BCE – guilt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Personification of a man’s luck and ability to effectively think and act is identified with some known figure of the pantheon, usually a minor deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumerian composition: “Man and his God”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man complains that what he knows does not come out right, what he says quite truthfully turns out to be false, he does things in all innocence and finds that he has been duped into committing wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His god – his powers of clear and fast thinking – is not there to suggest an answer when friends deceive him, or when evil-doers abuse him; his god has abandoned him and lost interest in him&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realization: blame lies with himself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plead: no man is perfect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He asks to be shown his faults, his transgressions, that he may confess them before his god and be forgiven; God is moved by his contrition and takes him back into favour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insight gained in the preceding millennium that the divine stands for, and upholds, a moral law -&amp;gt; is now bearing fruit in a realization of individual human responsibility, but also of innate human inability to live up to that responsibility&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd millenium BCE – the sword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As the settled areas of the country grew and joined, the protection that had been afforded by relative isolation was no longer there and fear of enemy attack, death or slavery, became a part of life ever present in the depth of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rise of great city-walls that around the towns in this period - the staggering amount of labor that must have gone into them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a shield against danger men looked to the now vitally important institutions of collective security, the great leagues and their officers, and particularly to the new institution of kingship as it took form and grew under the pressures of these years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gods, seen as kings and rulers, were no longer powers in nature only, they became powers in human affairs – in history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4th millenium BCE – famine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The powers to whom they turned were powers in and behind their primary economics on which life depended: fishing, herding, agriculture, as even the briefest look at the character of the chief gods of their cities will show. Aim and purpose of their cults were to insure the presence of these essential powers for fertility produce, and food. Houses – temples – were built for them so that they might dwell with men as members of the human community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i.e. ziggurats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this seems to be true of egyptian temples as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
