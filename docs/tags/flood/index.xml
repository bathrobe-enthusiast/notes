      <description>&lt;p&gt;The annual flood cycle of ancient Mesopotamia was poorly synchronised with the needs of the cultivators; in contrast to the Nile, whose monsoon-driven annual flood well matches the need of irrigation, the annual flood of both the Tigris and Euphrates peaks in the late spring, or early summer, as a result of winter rainfall and spring snowmelt on the mountains of Anatolia, Iran and Iraq. This not only threatens the ripening grain crops, but also requires that considerable efforts be made to protect the fields from flooding. There are scholars that suggest that the Sumerians expended more effort on flood control than in the distribution of water for irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;
