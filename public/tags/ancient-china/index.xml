      <description>&lt;p&gt;Li, in Confucianism, is a formalization of the philosophy behind the clearly sanctioned rules and behaviour that underpin Asian societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High yields have always supported large populations in monsoon Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states and empires of monsoon Asia were built consistently on their common peasant base of intensive, high-yield agriculture, which provided the great bulk of revenues, the manpower for armies, and the highly structured social order. [&amp;hellip;] The village worlds were largely self-governing and self-regulating, thanks to the family system, the kin network, and the basic social institutions common to the area as a whole, but they formed the essential foundation for the building and maintenance of empires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Background: unification and centralization by Qin provided a milieu in which the gentlemanly culture of Confucianism could flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han Confucianism was thus a conflation of earlier Confucianism, mystical cosmology, and authoritarian statism (CHC i. 107, 652). The Zhou notion of monarchy had been transformed, but the nature and extent of the change was not apparent in the language used. The ‘institutional framework’ was and remained a ‘legalist autocracy’ (Wang and Chang 1986: 12). But the state could now afford to be benevolent. Chinese historians have called it ‘outside Confucian, inside legalist’ (Zhengyuan Fu 1996: 8). As Bodde put it, ‘it is the Legalist/Confucian symbiosis evolved during the Han, with administrative controls at the top merging into self-administered behavioural standards below, that gave to the Chinese state the necessary combination of firmness and flexibility that enabled it to survive’ (CHC i. 90).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>China - Government by Non-Intervention</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;legalism1-and-daoism2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../legalism-overview/&#34;&gt;Legalism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../daoism-overview/&#34;&gt;Daoism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal text: Guanzi (管子)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By being ‘empty and still’, the emperor is supposed to be able to identify the ‘regulatory principles’ of the Dao which operate in both the natural and the human worlds. The &lt;em&gt;Guanzi&lt;/em&gt; insisted that ‘statutes, regulations, and measures be modeled on the Dao’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the right laws, in harmony with the cosmic principles, are in place, then the ruler just has to leave everyone to follow them. The actual business of government is in the hands of the chief minister and bureaucracy. This may be compared to Max Weber&amp;rsquo;s notion of a rule-bound bureaucracy (which he saw as characteristic of a modern state) under a charismatic head. It is bureaucrats who govern while the monarch maintains a ‘mystical link to the cosmic flow’: ‘administration is not his business’ (Lüshi Chunqiu, in ST 237). The ruler does not need to make personal decisions as such. As Shen Bu-Hai first put it, ‘he does not act, yet as a result of his non-action the world brings itself to a state of complete order’ (in Creel 1974: 64).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;entrapped-sovereign&#34;&gt;Entrapped Sovereign&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han Fei shared his predecessors’ view of the ruler as the pivot of sociopolitical order, the sole guarantor of stability and prosperity of his subjects; yet he was also bitterly aware of the ruler’s inadequacy. The very fact that the monarch—unlike his officials—owes his position to pedigree alone means that this position will more often than not be occupied by a mediocrity. Multiple historical examples scattered throughout &lt;em&gt;Han Feizi&lt;/em&gt; unequivocally demonstrate how devastating the ruler’s ineptitude can be. The intrinsic contradiction between an &lt;em&gt;institutionally infallible and humanly erring sovereign&lt;/em&gt; is the major source of tension in the Han Feizi (Pines 2013b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommendations: remain empty and tranquil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruler does not reveal his desires; should he do so, the minister will carve and embellish them. He does not reveal his views; should he do so, the minister will use them to present his different [opinion]. … The way of the enlightened sovereign is to let the knowledgeable completely exhaust their contemplations—then the ruler relies on them to decide on matters and is not depleted of knowledge; to let the worthy utilize their talents—then the ruler relies on them, assigns tasks, and is not depleted of abilities. When there is success, the ruler possesses a worthy [name]; when there is failure, the minister bears the responsibility. (&lt;em&gt;Han Feizi&lt;/em&gt; 5: 27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence the paradox of the entrapped sovereign, who enjoys God-like omnipotence, but who is required to refrain from any activism in order to preserve this omnipotence - a manifestation of the intrinsic contradiction of the authoritarian system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daoism - Overview</title>
      <link>/posts/daoism-overview/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Laozi: Confucius&amp;rsquo;s contemporary. Daoism is authored in 道德经.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laozi proposed a return to primitive simplicity, withdrawal from the world, spontaneity. They thought that society had become overdeveloped, overheated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The more prohibitions and rules, the poorer the people become&amp;hellip; The more elaborate the laws, the more they commit crimes&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corruption and oppression were the inevitable results of civilization and were brought about precisely by those whom others idealized—rulers and sages. In this view, the state is part of the problem, part of humanity’s misguided attempt to control the world. Solutions to human problems are to be sought only in the individual mind. This was the counter-culture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monarchy&#34;&gt;Monarchy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Daoists thought that the sage-ruler is himself &amp;lsquo;the unmoving director of the world&amp;rsquo;: his beneficence consists in going with the flow of events, like water flowing downhill; Laozi spoke of a sage-ruler perfectly in tune with Heaven and Earth, and with &amp;lsquo;the hearts and minds of the people&amp;rsquo;. &amp;lsquo;When he acts, he takes no credit&amp;rsquo;, for &amp;lsquo;the people say &amp;ldquo;we did it ourselves&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Legalism - Overview</title>
      <link>/posts/legalism-overview/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A ruler undertakes policies which, even though ‘people do not have the sense to rejoice in them’, are for their long-term benefit (Han Feizi, Basic Writings, 128–9); he ‘does not indulge the people’s desires, he simply looks ahead for what will benefit them’. The ruler may have to enforce his measures ‘against the will of the people’. The goals of the state—prosperity, stability, and expansion—were the only ones which would make life tolerable for the majority of people, and they were ones which people would choose if they could see sufficiently far ahead. This was their justification for compulsory labour, taxation, military service, and severe punishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the reasoning behind the policy, advocated by Shang Yang and
others, and first implemented in the state of Qin, of making punishments
exceptionally severe but predictable. With what would nowadays appear
breathtaking honesty, they advocated rule by fear as the most efficient way of securing the greatest good of the greatest number (Han Feizi, Basic Writings, 104). Only when light offences are ‘regarded as serious’ do ‘serious ones have no chance of coming’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War and killing are permissible so long as the aim is to abolish them. This means achieving what people want by means they do not want (Book of Lord Shang, 230, 285). It is only by going against the wishes of the people that you make them happy. ‘What I call punishment is the basis of righteousness, but what the world calls righteousness is the way of violence’ (Han Feizi, in Wang and Chang 1986: 46). In other words, they were implying that the outcome desired by Confucius could only be achieved by means he refused to contem- plate. It simply could not be achieved by persuasion and example (Book of Lord Shang, 325). The true lesson of history was that a great king ‘seized the world by force, but held it by righteousness’—an almost prophetic statement when one looks at the first two dynasties of the Chinese empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;li-and-ren&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Li&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ren&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Li&lt;/em&gt;: ritual, custom, decorum, propriety, ethics - a concept extended from a code of conduct and traditional conventions of social intercourse to embrace a &amp;ldquo;broad range of political activities, such as personnel policy, [and] proper handling of rewards and punishments&amp;rdquo;, so that it came to comprise the &amp;ldquo;entire way of governing&amp;rdquo;. Interpretation of the ethical and societal norms of &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt; was the focus of Confucian thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ren&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;lsquo;to overcome the self and turn to &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt;. The inner rationale that motivates people to observe &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt;. The humaneness that legitimizes political order (as interpreted by Mengzi, Confucius&amp;rsquo;s disciple). Confucius insisted that humaneness was the fundamental norm not only ofhuman conduct, but of political conduct and civilized government. It laid down both the goal and the methods of politics; it stipulated a harmonious society in which the virtuous lead by example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Confucius, government works best when the ruler is humane; the praxis was government by consensus - Heaven looking out from the little people, which enlightened paternalism is needed to lead, teach, and treat well. Persuasion is better than coercion. Confucius saw violence as the break- down of politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confucianism saw the state as a family.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hundred Schools of Thought</title>
      <link>/posts/hundred-schools-of-thought/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Main themes of Chinese political thought: state and monarchy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;state&#34;&gt;State&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature of scholar bureaucrats: 1. as political advisors, working in public service with a rank in the state hierarchy, they had a voice in the formation of the state; 2. as &lt;em&gt;itinerant&lt;/em&gt; political advisors, which gave them leverage and contributed to their intellectual independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In no other culture would the history of thought and the history of the state be so closely intertwined. Ethical and philosophical reflection developed in response to the increasingly problematic political situation. This was the period of ‘a hundred schools’. China produced a greater variety of political ideas than any other monarchical agrarian civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monarchy&#34;&gt;Monarchy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Chinese theories emphasized the need for a single locus of authority, a quasi-absolute monarch, to resolve the problem of human discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-qin-dynasty-inaugurated&#34;&gt;What Qin dynasty inaugurated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than two millennia this imperial government seemed to have a staying-power and a power of self-renewal which one finds in religions—but less often in states—in other parts of the world. In ancient China [&amp;hellip;] ‘political thought’ had a somewhat different function from the equivalent genre elsewhere. It brought together what we in the West divide into the sacred and the secular. Religions such as Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam were similarly based on sacred texts. But these supported a system of belief and practice rather than a system of government. China was the only text-based state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
