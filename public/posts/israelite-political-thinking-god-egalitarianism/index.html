<p>An ideological innovation on this scale was perhaps necessary [&hellip;] to validate their new political identity, which separated them so radically from all other peoples. It enabled them to survive as the type of economic entity which they aspired to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Re: Economic entity<br>
The Law stipulated that (rephrased) the &ldquo;means of production (land, herds and flocks)&rdquo; should be owned inalienably by extended families. The Jewish laws &ldquo;inhibited social stratification&rdquo; by eg. prohibiting interest on loans and the sale of land outside the family.</p>
